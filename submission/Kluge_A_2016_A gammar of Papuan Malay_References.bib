@inproceedings{Kroeger.2012,
 abstract = {Gazdar (1979:65--66), Levinson (1983:201), and Horn (1989:366) state that no language, so far as we know, lexicalizes the distinction between EXTERNAL (=sentence) vs. INTERNAL (=predicate) negation. This observation is made in discussing the supposed ambiguity of {\dq}presupposition-cancelling negation{\dq}, e.g. Russell's famous example: The King of France is not bald. External negation is identified with the reading in which this sentence is true (`It is not the case that the King of France is bald, because there is no King of France').

In this paper I present syntactic and semantic evidence showing that Malay/Indonesian does lexicalize the contrast between sentence vs. predicate negation. I show that, in verbal and adjectival clauses, tidak marks predicate negation while bukan marks sentence negation. However, preliminary investigation suggests that the sentence negation marker is not used for presupposition-cancelling negation, as would be expected based on most previous research on this topic. In particular, the Indonesian data seems to indicate that presupposition-cancelling negation is distinct from {\dq}metalinguistic negation{\dq}, contra Horn (1985, 1989).},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider how Eastern Indonesia may be treated as a linguistic area. We propose five defining linguistic features and we discuss their occurrence in some 40 Austronesian (AN) and non-Austronesian (NAN) languages of South Sulawesi, Flores, Sumba, Timor, Alor and Pantar, the Moluccas, Halmahera, the Bird{\grq}s Head, and the Cenderawasih Bay. We propose that of these five areal features, three are Papuan features that have diffused into the Austronesian languages, while two Austronesian features have diffused into the Papuan languages. These Papuan features are: (1) possessor-possessum order in adnominal possession, (2) overt marking of the distinction alienable vs. inalienable possession, and (3) clause-final negation. While these features are not generally found in Austronesian, we will demonstrate that they occur in many Austronesian languages in East Nusantara and around the Bird{\grq}s Head, as well as in the Papuan languages of this area The Austronesian features are: (4) SVO as primary constituent order, and (5) an inclusive/exclusive opposition in the pronominal paradigm. These features are not found in Papuan languages in general, yet they are attested in both the Papuan and the Austronesian languages of East Nusantara, as we will demonstrate. Although the features do not all converge on the same isoglosses, together they define a linguistic area: East Nusantara. This area has Halmahera and the Bird{\grq}s Head as its core, and radiates outwards to include the Moluccas and AlorIPantar first, followed by the island Timor.},

@inproceedings{Klamer.2013,
 abstract = {In the variety of Malay used by heritage speakers living in the Netherlands the expression of `give'-events varies considerably, and differs in interesting ways from the language it derived from. The majority of Malay heritage speakers grew up as simultaneous or early bilinguals and although Malay was often the language spoken at home , heritage speakers have Dutch as their dominant language. The language that was their input when they were children is the Malay variety spoken by the first generation, who originate from Ambon, Central Moluccas, and immigrated  to the Netherlands some 60 years ago in 1951-1952 (Tahitu 1989).

	A set of `give' expressions was elicited through visual stimuli: two video clips showing a person handing over something to another person (a pair of shoes, or a bag). Three groups of participants were asked to describe what they saw on the clip: (i) heritage speakers, (ii) first-generation speakers, and (iii) native speakers. Data from the first two groups was collected in the Netherlands (2011-2012), data from the Native speakers was collected in Ambon City in Indonesia in 2012.

	For the two clips there are responses by 28 heritage speakers, 18 native speakers, and 4 First generation speakers. We combined the group of Native speakers with the First generation speakers into one group of speakers that we refer to as `Baseline'  speakers here, as we assume that these speakers represent the variety of Malay from which Heritage Malay has derived. Both data sets thus had 22 Baseline responses.

	Malay `give' events are expressed with minimally one verb, the verb kasi `give'. Three arguments are part of this event: an Agent-like argument (A), a Recipient-like argument (R), and a Theme argument (T) (cf. Malchukov et. al. 2010:1). In this paper we first describe how Malay heritage speakers express give-constructions (section 2), focusing on the question how the Heritage speakers differ from the Baseline speakers (section 3). We will see that there is significant variation in how both sets of speakers encode the event and its participants T and R, and we attempt to explain this variation in section 4. A summary of the main conclusions is provided in section 5.},

 abstract = {Reduplication has generally been believed to be iconically motivated, though it has been noted that it can be used to express diminution and other types of meanings that cannot be accounted for in terms of iconicity alone. I claim that reduplication can be regarded as being both iconic and noniconic. There are two different iconic processes: a consecutive process and a cumulative process. In the consecutive process, PLURALITY in nouns and REPETITION/CONTINUATION in verbs are regarded as the prototypical meanings. In the cumulative process, INTENSITY is considered the prototypical meaning in both nouns and verbs. Through the noniconic process, on the other hand, reduplication obtains various meanings, among which DIMINUTION is the most frequent. Furthermore, it plays a significant role as an intracategory changer and a word-class changer. While there are iconic and noniconic processes, the prototypical meanings brought about by both processes represent the semantic principle {\dq}A HIGHER/LOWER DEGREE OF ....{\dq} Since this does not imply that noniconic processes are really iconic, it is proposed that the iconic nature and the semantic principle of reduplication should be given separate consideration. A variety of meanings brought about by noun and verb reduplication in the Malayo-Polynesian languages are explored based on this classification.},

 abstract = {IN THE 1950s, the people of West Papua (then Dutch New Guinea) were promised self- determination and eventual independence by their colonial masters. But in 1963 Indonesia took over the territory with the blessing of the USA, the UN and Australia . . Ever since, in a tragic clash of cultures and expectations, the Papuans have refused to 'bow to the inevitability' of Indonesian occupation and exploitation. This book reviews the long guerilla struggle of the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM) for a Free Papua, and traces the rise of a nonviolent independence movement alongside it - led by the Papua Council Presidium - following the fall of Indonesia's military dictator General Suharto in 1998. Peter King spent many months conducting research in the field, interviewing leading figures from the West Papuan independence movement, church groups and human rights NGOs. West Papua and Indonesia since Suharto places the currerit Papuan struggles in a context of failing Indonesian reform - where an abusive military is enjoying a political comeback. King argues that international intervention to resolve Papua's plight is now essential. Countries such as Australia, the UK and the US must act in concert through the UN once again, just as they did in East Timor during 1999. The Indonesian governmentand people - must be convinced that their best interests lie not in a 'security approach' steeped in violence towards the indigenous Papuans, which will only accelerate the threatened disintegration of their own republic, but in dialogue and negotiation.},

@incollection{Wischer.2006,
 abstract = {Grammaticalization (also `grammaticization') is generally regarded as a process by which linguistic elements (lexical, pragmatic, and sometimes even phonetic items) change into constituents of grammar, or by which grammatical items become more grammatical in time. Examples are the development of auxiliaries from lexical verbs, or prepositions from nouns; the development of inflections from free adpositions; and the change of word-orders that signal pragmatic meanings, like theme or rheme, into grammatical word-orders that signal the syntactic cases of subject and object. Furthermore, it includes the functionalization/ grammaticalization of phonological or prosodic features, such as palatalization and initial mutations to distinguish different cases; number and gender in Irish; or a particular tone taking over the function of a nominal classifier in Chinese. The whole concept of grammaticalization can be characterized as the diachronic process and the synchronic state of coding of grammatical categories, such as case, number, gender, tense, aspect, mood, etc. (for a general reference work cf. Hopper and Traugott, 2003). It is widely assumed that linguistic items historically go through the following stages:

Until the late 1970s, ideophones were almost exclusively described for African languages, but no ideophones were reported for languages of the Khoisan family. In recent years, an increased interest in ideophones has provided us with detailed studies in Khoisan, as well as in European, Asiatic, Australian, and Amerindian languages (cf.

@article{Marantz.1982,
 abstract = {In the recent literature, reduplication has been claimed to cause two serious problems for theories of morphology and phonology. First, as McCarthy (1979) points out, no one has developed an observationally adequate formalization of reduplication rules without adopting a notation which allows morphological rules to be written that never occur cross-linguistically. Most investigators have either implicitly (e.g. Wilbur (1973), Munro and Benson (1973)) or explicitly (e.g. Carrier( 1979)) employed a transformational no-tation for reduplicative processes. Munro and Benson (1973, 18) characterize a redu-plicative adjective formation rule of Luisefio as shown in (1), while Carrier (1979, 353) formulates a reduplication rule of Tagalog as shown in (2) (where M is a morpheme).

(1)  C1V1C2V2 + C1V1C2V2 + i + {\v{c}}

(2)  [(M) C V X

       1 2 3 4 --{\textgreater} 1, 2,      3     ,2, 3,4

                              [ - long]

Given the formal apparatus of (1) or (2), one can write many types of morphological rules which are not instantiated in natural languages. For example, although expressible in the transformationaln otations of (1) and (2), mirror-imager eduplicationr ules such as (3a,b) are not found in any language.

(3) a.  C1V1C2V2 + V2C2V1C1

     b.  CVCV

         1 2 3 4 --{\textgreater} 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4

An adequate theory of reduplication would formalize the process while allowing one to express only the sorts of reduplicationw hich occur cross-linguisticallya nd not the sorts of rules exemplified in (3).

Wilbur (1973) presents the most extensive discussion of the second apparent problem for an analysis of reduplication-its unusual interaction with certain phonological processes. As we shall see in section 2, some phonological rules appear to {\dq}overapply{\dq} to reduplicated forms, that is, to apply to segments in both the base and the copied material in a reduplicated form although only one set of these segments occurs in the proper environment for the application of the rule. This behavior of reduplicated forms has led some linguists (e.g. Carrier (1979)) to order the overapplying phonological processes before reduplication in the grammar. The output of these processes may thus be copied by reduplication, yielding the appearance of overapplication. Although this approach accounts for the occurrence of the output of the phonological processes in both the base and the copied material, it has the result of mixing morphological and phonological processes. The conceptually simpler theory would place these processes in separate components of the grammar. Moreover, as Wilbur (1973) points out, the ordering ap-proach would not be able to account for the other puzzling interaction of phonological rules with reduplication: some phonological rules appear to underapply to reduplicated forms; that is, they do not apply to segments in either the base or the copied material in a reduplicated form although one set of these segments occurs in the environment of the rule. An adequate theory of reduplication would explain these apparently aberrant interactions of reduplication and phonological processes and predict just which pho-nological processes will {\dq}over- and underapply{\dq} to reduplicated forms.

The solution to these problems associated with reduplication is simply to make the minimal special assumptions or statements about reduplication. Except for the fact that the material attached to the stem in reduplication resembles the stem phonologically, reduplication rules look like normal affixation processes. To provide the best account of reduplication rules, we say they are normal affixation processes. The one unique feature of reduplication, the feature which leads us to group together diverse morpho-logical processes under the title reduplication, is the resemblance of the added material to the stem being reduplicated. As demonstrated in section 1, we can devise a simple procedure for lending to the reduplicating affix phonemic material from the stem to which it attaches without adding unneeded power to the grammar.

The solution to problems posed by reduplication, then, is to say that there is nothing special about reduplication other than the resemblance between the affix and the stem to which it is attached. An extension of John McCarthy's recent account of Arabic verbal paradigms (McCarthy (1979; 1981)) provides a simple formalism for reduplicating processes which does not involve the full power of transformations( section 1). As for the interaction of reduplication with phonological and other morphological rules (section 2), once we establish that reduplication is simply affixation, recent improvements in phonological and morphological theory explain this interaction by predicting which rules will appear to over- and underapply to reduplicated forms. No special ordering of re-duplication rules or special conditions on phonological rules prove necessary to account for the data.},

These items stick out in terms of their syllable structure and/or stress pattern. Hence, I suspect that they might be non-Malay roots. What do you think? 

giawas 'guava' 

grobak 'wheelbarrow' 

honai 'traditional.Dani hut'

kombong 'inflated'

koteka 'penis sheath' 

krempeng 'thin'

palungku or flungku 'fist' 

pakwel 'k.o. crowbar' 



Well, {\_}grobak{\_} and {\_}krempeng{\_} re definitely of (Bazaar/Ucontact) Malay origin. The standeard indonesian Malay spellings are: gerobak and kerempeng [ker{\'e}mp{\'e}ng]. 

{\_}kombong{\_} is a loaned cognate of Malay kembung (the penultimate vowel is schwa). It might be worthwhile to check whether it is from Javanese. 

{\_}palungku{\_} and {\_}pakwel{\_} are likely to be from some vernacular Malay dialect of East Indonesia, but I canot say from which. Try checking Ambon Malay for a start 

{\_}giawas{\_} is probably a loan from an ultimately Spanish plural guayabas. 

{\_}koteka{\_} is certinly, and {\_}bonai{\_} very likely to be of local indigenous origin. 



kecuali 'except' - *cuali does not exist in Papuan Malay 

The ultimate baseword is probably a no longer existent *cual probably meaning something like 'pry up, gouge out', and is affixed here with a no longer productive combination of prefix ke- and suffix -i. But this is just a speculative guess of mine. In modern Malay the word as a whole is not morphologically divisible.



keluar 'go out' - luar as well as dari/di luar do exist in Papuan Malay 

In Standard indonesian Malay there are two morphologically distinct {\_}keluar{\_}-s, the one is a combination of the proclitic {\_}ke{\_} 'to, towards' and the locative {\_}luar{\_} 'outside, external'.The other is the compound verb {\_}keluar{\_} 'go out(wards)'. The former is the antonym of {\_}ke dalam{\_}, the latter of {\_}masuk{\_}. It was not always clear, which of the two is meant in written texts, because in s{\'o}me contexts, both are possible. This only changed after the spelling reform required the former to spelled du{\'i}sunctedly as {\_}ke luar{\_}. 

But whatever the case, the ke- here is not th prefix ke-, but the (homonymixc) preposition.



keliar 'roam about' - liar 'be wild' does exist in Papuan Malay but my corpus does not include di/dari liar 

This was historically probably a derivation with profix {\_}ke-{\_}, that has meanwhile become incorporated into the word, so that on the diachri{\'o}nic plain {\_}keliar{\_} is a basic (non-derived) word.



olahraga 'do sports' - Russell lists this item as olah - raga (both parts are Malay)

Russel Jones is right. Well, the way I see it, this is a case of the classical question of whether you are preparing a treatment of the synchrony or the diachrony. The former covers affixes and root-morphemes being features of the contemporaneous language. The latter covers historical roots that are not necessarily still independent features of the morphology anymore. In the present example, the situation is even more simple, however. If as you say the word was acquired in Papuan Malay as a whole, while the substituent items in the donor Malay dialect were not acquired as well. Ror Papuan Malay then, the entire entity {\_}olahraga{\_} is morphologically indivisible 

Of course, real life can play the meanest strokes on thngs that theoretically sem so simple. Bilingual speakers who also have a substantial mastery of Standard indonesian Malay could be well aware of the etymology, even if they never use the historically basic items whe speaking the vernacular.

Anyway, the source of gerobak in standard Malay is relatively obvious. it was apparently borrowed via Bazaar Malay from Javanese grobag (with final g, that excludes the likelihood of a borrowing in te reverse direction). As for ker{\'e}mp{\'e}ng, finding te source is more difficult.It does not seem to be an original item of nuclear (Riau-Johore) Malay, but is also not attested for eithr Javanese or Sundanese (also not *kerimping). I only found it in Jakarta Malay. I haven't had time to search further yet so far.},

Consideration is also given to the origins and evolution of definite articles in the light of the comparative and theoretical findings. Among the claims advanced are that definiteness does not occur in all languages though the pragmatic concept which it grammaticalizes probably does, that many languages have definiteness in their pronoun system but not elsewhere, that definiteness is not inherent in possessives, and that definiteness is to be assimilated to the grammatical category of person.},

We conceived of this volume in the fear that our current picture of 'compoundhood' might be like the blind men{\grq}s elephant, and in the hope that by putting together the disparate pieces of what we know, something like the whole elephant might appear. Each of us might have a limited perception, illuminating and interesting in its own way, but no one perspective gives the whole story. What we endeavor to do in this Handbook is to give a variety of pictures of compounding that both complicate and deepen our understanding of this important means of extending the lexicon of a language.

Our intention is to complicate our view both theoretically and descriptively. In terms of theory, we consider compounding from disparate frameworks, both generative and non-generative, and from different perspectives: synchronic, diachronic, psycholinguistic, and developmental. Descriptively, we hope to sharpen our understanding of what constitutes a compound by looking not only at familiar languages, but also at a range of typologically and areally diverse languages. The two views are complementary.

@incollection{Lewis.2015,
 abstract = {The Problem of Language Identification



How one chooses to define a language depends on the purposes one has in identifying one language as being distinct from another. Some base their definition on purely linguistic grounds, focusing on lexical and grammatical differences. Others may see social, cultural, or political factors as being primary. In addition, speakers themselves often have their own perspectives on what makes a particular language uniquely theirs. Those are frequently related to issues of heritage and identity much more than to the actual linguistic features. In addition, it is important to recognize that not all languages are oral. Sign languages constitute an important class of linguistic varieties that merit consideration.

Due to the nature of language and the various perspectives brought to its study, it is not surprising that a number of issues prove controversial. Of preeminence in this regard is the definition of the basic unit which the Ethnologue reports on: what constitutes a language?



Language as particle, wave, and field

Scholars recognize that languages are not always easily nor best treated as discrete, identifiable, and countable units with clearly defined boundaries between them (Makoni and Pennycook 2006). Rather, a language is more often comprised of continua of features that extend across time, geography, and social space. There is growing attention being given to the roles or functions that language varieties play within the linguistic ecology of a region or a speech community. The Ethnologue approach to listing and counting languages as though they were discrete units does not preclude a more dynamic understanding of the linguistic makeup of the countries and regions we report on.

While discrete linguistic varieties can be distinguished, we also recognize that those varieties exist in a complex set of relationships to each other. Languages can be viewed simultaneously as discrete units (particles) amenable to being listed and counted, as continua of features across time and space (waves) that are best studied in terms of variational tendencies as examples of ``change in progress'' (Weinreich, Labov and Herzog 1968), and as parts of a larger ecological matrix (field), where functional roles and usage of the linguistic codes for a wide range of purposes are more in focus. All three of these, language as particle, wave, and field (Lewis 1999; Pike 1959), are useful and important perspectives. Ethnologue focuses primarily on the unitary nature of languages without prejudice against the other perspectives.



Language and dialect

As part of the wave-like nature of language in general, every language is characterized by variation within the speech communities that use it. Innovations of new features and retentions of long-standing lexical, phonological or grammatical features spread like waves across geographic and social space and come and go over time. Varieties which share similar features diverge from one another to different degrees. Divergent varieties are often referred to as dialects. In some cases, they may be distinct enough that some would consider them to be separate languages. In other cases, the varieties may be sufficiently similar to be considered merely characteristic of a particular geographic region, social grouping, or historical era. Sometimes speakers may be very aware of dialect variation and be able to label a particular dialect with a name. In other cases, the variation may go largely unnoticed or overlooked. For many, the term dialect is a pejorative term that identifies a variety as being in some way deficient or inadequate.

Not all scholars share the same set of criteria for distinguishing what level of divergence distinguishes a ``language'' from a ``dialect'' and therefore the terms are not always consistently applied. Since the fifteenth edition (2005), Ethnologue has followed the ISO 639-3 inventory of identified languages (http://www.sil.org/iso639-3) as the basis for our listing of languages.



ISO 639-3 criteria for language identification

The ISO 639-3 standard applies the following basic criteria for defining a language in relation to varieties which may be considered dialects:

Two related varieties are normally considered varieties of the same language if speakers of each variety have inherent understanding of the other variety at a functional level (that is, can understand based on knowledge of their own variety without needing to learn the other variety).

Where spoken intelligibility between varieties is marginal, the existence of a common literature or of a common ethnolinguistic identity with a central variety that both understand can be a strong indicator that they should nevertheless be considered varieties of the same language.

Where there is enough intelligibility between varieties to enable communication, the existence of well-established distinct ethnolinguistic identities can be a strong indicator that they should nevertheless be considered to be different languages.

These criteria make it clear that the identification of ``a language'' is not based on linguistic criteria alone.

The language entries in Ethnologue include a listing of dialect names. In most cases, those listings are not based on rigorous dialectology. Rather, these lists include all names reported to us which may, at one time or another, have been used in reference to a local variety of a language. Names listed may be alternate names for the same linguistic variety.



Macrolanguages

In addition to defining three-letter codes for individual languages, the ISO 639-3 standard also defines codes for macrolanguages. The latter are defined in the standard as ``multiple, closely related individual languages that are deemed in some usage contexts to be a single language.'' Macrolanguages were introduced into the standard in order to handle cases in which varieties would be considered distinct languages by the criterion of non-intellgibility as described above, but had already been given a code as a single language by the previously existing ISO 639-2 standard. For instance, Arabic [ara] and Chinese [zho] were already defined in ISO 639-2 on the basis of a writing system and literature shared across many spoken varieties.

Languages like these (with their existing three-letter codes) entered into ISO 639-3 as macrolanguages, and the varieties that were so distinct as not to be intelligible to each other received new three-letter codes as individual languages. The standard then enumerates the set of individual languages that are the members of each macrolanguage. It is important to note that macrolanguages are more than just groups of related languages. The individual languages that comprise a macrolanguage must be closely related, and there must be some domain in which they are commonly viewed as comprising a single language.

This edition of Ethnologue includes entries for 60 macrolanguages as identified in the ISO 639-3 standard. The addition of this conceptualization of language provides us with a way to represent the fact that linguistic varieties function simultaneously as both individual units and within a larger functional matrix. Macrolanguage entries are brief, consisting largely of a listing of the individual languages that comprise them.



Sign languages

There are hundreds of sign languages in the world, created and used by deaf people. This edition of Ethnologue lists 137 living sign languages. As the primary language of daily face-to-face communication for their respective communities of users, these languages fall within the scope of the Ethnologue. The deaf sign languages listed in language entries are those used exclusively within deaf communities. The listings include only natural sign languages, not signed versions of spoken languages (manual codes), which typically have names like ``Signed English'' or ``Signed French.'' Manual codes are, however, sometimes mentioned in the entries for individual sign languages. Generally, we do not include manual systems invented primarily for use by hearing people that are not full languages (e.g., hand signals in sports), though some manual systems that have been assigned ISO 639-3 codes and are used as second languages only are included in our listings.},

 abstract = {Since creole languages draw their properties from both their substrate and superstrate sources, the typological classification of creoles has long been a major issue for creolists, typologists, and linguists in general. Several contradictory proposals have been put forward in the literature. For example, creole languages typologically pair with their superstrate languages (Chaudenson 2003), with their substrate languages (Lefebvre 1998), or even, creole languages are alike (Bickerton 1984) such that they constitute a ``definable typological class'' (McWhorter 1998). This book contains 25 chapters bearing on detailed comparisons of some 30 creoles and their substrate languages. As the substrate languages of these creoles are typologically different, the detailed investigation of substrate features in the creoles leads to a particular answer to the question of how creoles should be classified typologically. The bulk of the data show that creoles reproduce the typological features of their substrate languages. This argues that creoles cannot be claimed to constitute a definable typological class.},

However, some of the very features of language that give it this power under some circumstances may, under other circumstances, become major sources of disintegration and internal conflict within national system. These considerations should have some definite implications for language policy not only in developing nations but also in long-established nations marked by diglossia - whether officially recognized (as in Canada or in Belgium) or unrecognized (as in the United States), Specifically, I will try to argue that, while the development of a national language may be highly conducive to the creation and strengthening of national identity, the deliberate use of language for purposes of national identity may - at least in a multiethnic state - have more disruptive than unifying consequences.},

It provides vocabularies (mini-dictionaries of about 1000-2000 entries) of 41 languages from around the world, with comprehensive information about the loanword status of each word. It allows users to find loanwords, source words and donor languages in each of the 41 languages, but also makes it easy to compare loanwords across languages.

Each vocabulary was contributed by an expert on the language and its history. An accompanying book is being published by Mouton de Gruyter (Loanwords in the World's Languages: A Comparative Handbook, edited by Martin Haspelmath {\&} Uri Tadmor).

The World Loanword Database 2009 consists of vocabularies contributed by 41 different authors or author teams. When citing material from the database, please cite the corresponding vocabulary (or vocabularies).

The database can be accessed by language, by meaning, by author, or by reference.

The World Loanword Database 2009 is the result of a collaborative project coordinated by Uri Tadmor and Martin Haspelmath between 2004 and 2008, called the Loanword Typology Project (LWT). Most of the contributors took part in workshops at which the procedures for selecting and annotating words were discussed extensively. The list of 1460 meanings on which the vocabularies are based is called the Loanword Typology meaning list, and it is in turn based on the list of the Intercontinental Dictionary Series.},

The earliest attempts at defining adverbs reflect the etymology of the word (cf. Latin ad-verbium): adverbs are ``used in construction with a verb'' (Appolonios Dyscolos). Even today, manner adverbs are typically considered the core group of adverbs.

One definition commonly encountered in linguistic textbooks is more general than the one proposed by scholars in classical antiquity: adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. Apart from its patent circularity, the traditional textbook definition does not apply to countless items that are commonly classified as adverbs (e.g., words that usually relate to whole sentences, such as fortunately). Many linguists have tried to remedy the shortcomings of traditional accounts by assigning some putative `adverbs' to other word classes (cf. `Semantics versus syntax').},

Although the nature of clause combining within a prosodic sentence has always been a central concern of traditional syntax (in GG, e.g. it underlies important research on deletion and anaphora), work within a discourse analysis framework has hardly been done. Analyses like this are given in the present volume.



This vol in the Typological Studies in Language series contains an Introduction by the editors {\&} 13 Chpts. Works adopting a discourse analysis approach to clause combining are presented. Wallace Chafe - Linking Intonation Units in Spoken English - examines linkages between intonation units in spoken discourse. Linkages may be accomplished through intonation alone, or through use of {\dq}coordinating{\dq} connectives including and, but, so, like, I mean, etc, or {\dq}subordinating{\dq} connectives. Carol Genetti - A Syntactic Correlate of Topicality in Newari Narrative - explores an alternative in the case marking of subject noun phrases in clause chains found in the narrative texts of Newari, a Tibeto-Burman language of Nepal. It is argued that the case marking alternation cannot be accounted for syntactically or semantically but must be considered as a function of discourse pragmatics. John Haiman - InconsequentialClauses in Hua and the Typology of Clauses - discusses means of expressing the meaning typically expressed by English but, in the Papuan language Hua, with emphasis on the so-called inconsequential construction. Relative distribution of the inconsequential {\&} the conditional is considered {\&} the unusual nature of grammatical categories in this language is emphasized. Martin Harris - Concessive Clauses in English and Romance - analyzes the semantics of concessive conditionals. It is argued that the concessive conditional sets up a hypothesis the realization of which, if {\&} when it occurs, would bring into existence a situation in which a particular type of concessive interpretation would be relevant. The analysis is based on a comparison of concessives in English {\&} in Romance languages. Ekkehard Konig {\&} Johan van der Auwera - Clause Integration in German and Dutch Conditionals, Concessive Conditionals, and Concessives - explores broader issues of subordination {\&} clause combining in syntax through a discussion of conditionals {\&} concessives in Dutch {\&} German. Methods of combining these constructions with a main clause are described as lying along a continuum from parataxis to embedding. Knud Lambrecht - Presentational Cleft Constructions in Spoken French - examines the avoir-cleft construction used in spoken French as a presentational construction {\&} in an {\dq}event reporting{\dq} pragmatic function. The unusual nature of the relationship between main {\&} subordinate clauses in these event reporting sentences is examined. Christian Lehmann - Towards a Typology of Clause Linkage - provides a survey of the significant aspects of complex clause formations in the languages of the world. Cross-linguistic types of clause linkage are identified. Lorna MacDonald - Subordination in Tauya - examines subordinates marked by -na in the Papuan language Tauya. Analysis centers on the inconsequential construction {\&} their pragmatic {\&} structural independence from the main clause is discussed. Lynell Marchese - Sequential Chaining and Discourse Structure in Godie - explores the sequential auxiliary in Godie, an Eastern Kru language spoken in the Ivory Coast. The syntactic {\&} discourse characteristics of its use as a chaining device are examined, {\&} speaker motivations for its use are described. Christian Matthiessen {\&} Sandra A. Thompson - The Structure of Discourse and 'Subordination' - examines the structure of discourse within which subordinate clauses appear. It is argued that characterization of the subordinate clause at the sentence level is neither desirable nor possible. A discourse model of the notion {\dq}subordinate clause{\dq} is outlined based on an evaluation of written English discourse. Marianne Mithun - The Grammaticization of Coordination - describes ways in which coordination is grammaticized in several typologically different languages. It is shown that this apparently basic device is actually highly diverse from one language to the next, but is also easily borrowed. John Myhill {\&} Junko Hibiya - The Discourse Function of Clause-Chaining - provides an empirical study of clause chaining constructions in Japanese {\&} Soddo, a Semitic language spoken in Southern Ethiopia. It is shown that these constructions are not, as has been previously claimed, associated with a foregrounding function. Johanna Nichols - Nominalization and Assertion in Scientific Russian Prose - examines the use of the Russian verbal noun in contexts where English translation uses assertion or a finite verb. The basing of the choice to use assertion or nonassertion, {\&} finite or nominalized verb form, in the grammatical category inventory of the language is described.},

 abstract = {Linguistics started small, concentrating on sounds and words before phrases and sentences. There is always excitement in new ideas about those areas, and the subject matter has always shown itself tough enough to be challenging. A linguist could fill a lifetime without needing to ask whether the framework he worked in might also extend to take in larger segments of verbal behavior.

Now that some of us are trying to expand our horizons beyond the sentence to paragraphs and even entire discourses, we seem to draw two kinds of reactions. One is encouraging and a little wistful. Colleagues see that linguistics can go in that direction and wish they had time to join us in finding out how. The other reaction is mildly surprising for a field in which one or another set of young Turks has nearly always held the center of the stage: it is suggested either that we can't work on discourse, because it has been convincingly demonstrated that such work is impossible, or that we shouldn't, because everything beyond the sentence is the fiefdom of the rhetoricians, or the critics, or the logicians.

Since I take it as a principle that the way to sell soap is not to waste time arguing that Brand X won't get the dirt out, but rather to show the way your own product does its job, I propose no lengthy critique that will demolish one by one the negative arguments about discourse. In Section One of this chapter I will touch lightly on the criticisms I am aware of, then go on in Section Two to the reasons why I think it is not only possible but also downright enlightening to study discourse. The third section of the chapter will sketch some possible consequences of discourse study.},

@article{Hay.2001,
 abstract = {While it is widely assumed that high-frequency morphologically complex forms tend to display characteristics of noncompositionality, models of morphological processing do not predict a direct relationship between absolute frequency and decomposition. Rather, they predict a relationship between decomposition and the relative frequency of the derived form and the base. This paper argues that such a relative frequency effect does, indeed, exist.

First, the results of a simple experiment demonstrate that subjects perceive derived forms that are more frequent than their bases to be significantly less complex than matched counterparts that are less frequent than their bases. And second, dictionary calculations reveal that derived forms that are more frequent than their bases are significantly more likely to display symptoms of semantic drift than derived forms containing higher-frequency bases. High-frequency forms, however, are no more prone to semantic drift than low-frequency forms.

These results provide evidence that it is relative frequency, rather than absolute frequency, that affects the decomposability of morphologically complex words. A low-frequency form is likely to be nontransparent if it is composed of even-lower-frequency parts. And a high-frequency form may be highly decomposable if the base word it contains is higher frequency still.},

 abstract = {It has often been argued that the (type or token) frequency of an affix in the lexicon cannot be used to predict the degree to which that affix is productive. Affix type frequency refers to the number of different words which contain an affix, token frequency refers to the summed lexical frequency of those words. The observation that neither of these counts relates straigh'tforwardly to productivity, raises difficult questions about the source of different degrees of productivity, making the nature of morphological productivity one of the {\dq}central mysteries of word-formation{\dq} (Aronoff 1976:35). If productivity does not arise as a function of frequency, then where does it come from?

This paper argues that frequency and productivity are, in fact, intimately linked. Type and token frequency in the lexicon are not good predictors of productivity. But frequency counts of decomposed forms in the lexicon can predict the degree to which an affix is likely to be productive. The problem with doing a straightforward frequency count of forms containing an affix, is that not all affixed forms contain the affix to the same degree. Some affixed words are highly affixed, and are highly decomposable (e.g. tasteless). Other affixed words appear more opaque, and tend to be characterised by whole word access, rather than parsing (e.g. listless). We argue that the former set facilitate productivity much more strongly than the latter set.},

English conditionals are typically of the form if A, (then) B, where A and B are the antecedent and consequent, respectively. Some examples are given in (1).

In the linguistic and philosophical literature, a distinction is commonly drawn between indicative conditionals, such as (1a) and (1b), and subjunctive or counterfactual conditionals, like (1c). This classification is not uncontroversial: some authors would draw the major dividing line between (1a) and (1c) on the one hand and (1b) on the other. However, we adopt the standard classification and focus on indicative conditionals (see also Counterfactuals). The class of indicatives may be further divided into predictive and nonpredictive conditionals, illustrated in (1a) and (1b), respectively. Despite subtle differences, these share a common semantic core and have similar logical properties.We do not distinguish between them in this discussion.},

While it shares some linguistic features with other contact varieties of Malay in the region, it is also distinguished by its own contact history and unique features in its phonology, lexicon and grammar, all showing evidence of significant influence from substrate languages. One notable feature is the pervasiveness and variety of its serial verb constructions (SVC). This paper explores the forms and functions of a limited set of Kupang SVCs, showing close parallels with similar forms and functions of SVCs in nearby substrate languages (illustrated by data from Helong, Amarasi, Dhao, and Lole). While Kupang is in a post-creole continuum with Indonesian functioning as the ``high'', the Kupang SVCs described in this paper have no close parallels in Indonesian. We conclude that this presents strong evidence that Kupang is indeed a creole that has calqued at a deep level on the grammars of local languages. Since the phenomena here are previously undescribed for any of the languages -- and all of them are poorly documented -- this paper is deliberately rich in data. The examples given are not rare, were taken from computer searches of a text corpus, and have been doubled-checked for naturalness with groups of native speakers, given the inherent pitfalls of working in a post-creole continuum.},

This paper examines both diachronic evidence from classical Malay texts (17th to 19th century) and the influence of contact languages (in particular southern Chinese dialects) on the grammaticalization of Malay lexical noun empunya into a stance marker in sentence-final position, and also as an attitudinal intensifier in pre-adjectival position. Converging evidence points to the pivotal role of pronominal uses of empunya in facilitating the development of new grammatical and pragmatic functions.

The three most important instruments which the sultan of Tidore employed when exercising his authority in Geelvink Bay were the appointing of headmen, the collecting of tribute, and if this was not paid, the sending of a fleet of war canoes, the so-called hongi. In fact, the hongi expeditions turned out to be raids, bringing death, slavery, and devastation in their wake. In 1861 the GovernorGeneral of the Netherlands Indies banned any further sending of hongi expeditions without his express permission. The effects of banning the hongi expeditions reveal thetnselves in Dutch reports of the seventies. In these reports it was made clear that the sultan's authority and his revenues were decreasing. However, it appears that even before 1861 intervention from remote Tidore was not considerable. It seetns the banning decree did not have the dramatic effects on the sultan's position in Geelvink Bay as has been claimed.},

 abstract = {Much of what we have to say in the present paper should be thought of as an attempt to get a better understanding of the intricate complexities surrounding focus adverbs. To this end, we discuss a number of restrictions which govern the occurrence of different classes of focus adverbs in Dutch, German and English. We are aware that in doing so we limit ourselves primarily to the descriptive level---a decision which some may well disapprove of. Indeed, when Pullum (1988) speaks of the 'slow agony of empirical endeavor', he characterizes this position in the following way: 'Simply listing facts will do us no good . . . It it easy. It is boring. Anyone can do it. But ultimately it is useless to serious linguistic research.' It goes without saying that we, too, completely disagree with this way of presenting the matter. When one tries to characterize focus phonemena, it is immediately clear that there are numerous lexical differences which interact in subtle ways with regular syntactic and semantic patterns. In our opinion, a linguistically interesting theory of focus should be able to account for these differential patterns. The strategy followed explicitly by Altmann (1976, 1978) and Jacobs (1983), and implicitly by many others, which is to concentrate a few common focus particles (often the words for only and even), and to hope that the rest will somehow conform to the patterns exhibited by the selected items, may lead to some initial progress, but must eventually be replaced by a more comprehensive effort. It is dangerous to rely too much on the assumed homogeneity of linguistic classes, especially in the closed-class systems. It is also important to gain a comparative perspective on focus adverbs by comparing items from different languages if a theory is to be constructed with the explanatory depth and broad empirical coverage of current theories of WH-movement or anaphoric dependencies. We give a number of examples where it is useful to compare items taken from English, German and Dutch. To summarize: this paper reviews some of the major problems which a comprehensive theory of focus adverbs needs to address, describes some of the variations to be found among focus adverbs, and places this against the background of some of the available accounts of focus adverbs.},

It is common to assume that these roots cannot occur without any affixation and that, therefore, they should be considered precategorial. Here it is shown that this view is ill-conceived. To begin with, it is possible to distinguish different classes of roots based on morphological features. Therefore, roots are not precategorial. Furthermore, a large majority of the putative verbal roots allows for unaffixed uses. However, 'verbal roots' have 'non-verbal' meanings when used without voice marking. Inasmuch as it can be shown that voice-marked forms have clearly 'verbal' meanings, it follows that voice marking is derivational (among many other things).},

The standard procedure in reference grammars is to give a few examples for straightforward situational use (pointing to visible entities located at various degrees of distance away from the speaker), and to add a remark stating that the demonstratives may also be used anaphorically to refer back to a referent previously introduced in the discourse. This procedure is based on the assumption -- also underlying much of the theoretical work on demonstratives -- that straightforward situational use is, in some sense, the basic use of demonstratives and that anaphoric use is derived from it. Assuming this, then, the fact that a demonstrative may be used anaphorically becomes a noteworthy fact. But is this really the case? Are demonstratives not universally amenable to anaphoric use? How about other frequently noted uses of demonstratives such as the discourse deictic use? Put more generally: Which uses of demonstratives may be safely assumed as universally attested in natural languages?

 abstract = {Grammatical relations -- in particular the relation 'subject of' -- and voice are of central concern to any theory of universal grammar. With respect to these phenomena the analysis of Tagalog (and the Philippine languages in general) has turned out to be particularly difficult and continues to be a matter of debate. What traditionally has been called passive voice in these languages [$\ldots$] appears to be so different from voice phenomena in the more familiar Indo-European languages that the term 'focus' was introduced in the late 1950s to underscore its 'exceptional' nature [...]. Furthermore, [$\ldots$] an inflationary use has been made of the term 'ergative' in the last decade; it can thus no longer be assumed that it has an unequivocal and specific meaning in typologizing languages, apart from the technical definition it might be given within a particular framework. But if the Philippine 'focus' constructions are neither passive nor ergative, how else can they be analysed? [...] In this paper a ease will be made for the claim that 'focus' marking should be analysed in terms of orientation, a concept used [$\ldots$] for capturing the difference between English (and, more generally, Indo-European) orientated nominalisations such as 'employ-er' or 'employ-ee', and unorientated nominalisations such as 'employ-ing'. This approach implies that 'focus' marking is derivational rather than inflectional as often presumed in the literature. This is to say that what is typologically conspicuous in Tagalog is not the 'focus' phenomenon per se, since this is very similar to orientated nominalisations in many other languages, but rather the very prominent use of orientated formations (i.e., derivational morphology) in basic clause structure.},

@incollection{Helmbrecht.2011,
 abstract = {Map 45A is concerned with politeness distinctions in personal pronouns, and more specifically second person pronouns. This phenomenon has been particularly well-studied in European languages. In German, for instance, there is a threefold distinction between a second person singular du 'you.SG.FAMILIAR', a second plural ihr 'you.PL.FAMILIAR', and a second person polite Sie 'you.HONORIFIC', which does not distinguish number. The polite pronoun Sie is the default form of address among German adults who are not in a close social relation to each other. If they are relatives, married, close friends, professional colleagues, or university students, they are very likely to use the familiar du to address each other. The usage of du and Sie is symmetrical (the one who gives Sie (or du) will also receive it), with one exception: Adults address children and adolescents with du, but receive Sie.

The simplified example of the usage of German du and Sie given here demonstrates that a single grammatical distinction (familiar versus polite) corresponds to a complex set of pragmatic rules and social contexts determining the choice between the two forms. In addition, the pragmatic rules which determine the choice of du and Sie are not identical to those of other languages with a binary politeness distinction in pronouns. Although there is a significant degree of overlap in the conditioning factors of the usage of du and Sie in German, tu (you.SG.FAM) and vous (you.HON) in French, and ty (you.SG.FAM) and vy (you.HON) in Russian, there are also significant pragmatic differences. In French, for example, the mother-in-law continues to be addressed by the (new) son-in-law or daughter-in-law with the polite form vous, whereas in German, the mother-in-law always receives the familiar form from the (new) son/daughter-in-law. In Russian, the usage of ty and vy is also conditioned by the affective relation between the interlocutors, the topic, and the discourse context (cf. Friedrich 1966, 1972). Interlocutors can change from the polite form of address to the familiar form and back again with certain pragmatic effects. This is not possible in a conversation of German interlocutors. Once two German interlocutors have agreed on the familiar form of address, they cannot return to the polite form.},

 abstract = {The subject of this study are words like I, you, we, he, they etc. and their equivalents in other languages. These words are used in discourse to refer to oneself, or to the addressee, or to someone else who is not present, but is talked about, or groups of human individuals that are associated with the speaker or hearer. The particularity of personal pronouns - compared to other parts of speech in language -- is the way they establish reference to a single human individual or a group of individuals. On the one hand, I and you are inherently referential, i.e. they are pointers to some person being present at the time of speaking, on the other hand, this person can only be identified on the basis of the recognition of who is performing which speech act role at the moment of speaking. In addition, there is a remarkable relationship between these words, which makes them highly flexible in their use in discourse. Linguistic communication usually means that people interact over a certain stretch of time in exchanging information, requests, commands or whatever. In conversations and dialogs, people talk to someone and listen to the same person in an alternating way. This alternation of speech roles associated with the interlocutors is reflected in the alternating reference of personal pronouns. If a speaker starts out to talk about himself using I to refer to himself, he will be addressed by you in the next moment when the hearer takes over the turn referring to himself with the same word I the first speaker just has used. The semantic categories of personal pronouns and their formal organization in paradigms reflect the interactive structure of communication. Because of this property, personal pronouns have been termed shifters by Jespersen (1923) and later by Jabobson (1971[1957]). The idea that personal pronouns are inseparably connected to speech act roles has been formulated most clearly by Benveniste (1947, 1956). The values of the grammatical category person encoded in personal pronouns are functional notions. These values determine the reference of the form. They are functional because they are used by the speaker for a purpose, namely to refer to the individual he or she wants to talk about. The functional view on personal pronouns in the Benveniste/ Jakobson tradition is one of the basic theoretical concepts adopted in this study that will be developed further in the respective theoretical chapters.},

Imitations are similar to their models, an un-serious version of something. In your example I would interpret the epileptic seizure as {\dq}a little death{\dq}. Does this make sense?

Or in Dressler (1968): iterativity {\textgreater} infrequency {\textgreater} un-seriousness

 abstract = {This book presents a challenge to the widely-held assumption that human languages are both similar and constant in their degree of complexity. For a hundred years or more the universal equality of languages has been a tenet of faith among most anthropologists and linguists. It has been frequently advanced as a corrective to the idea that some languages are at a later stage of evolution than others. It also appears to be an inevitable outcome of one of the central axioms of generative linguistic theory: that the mental architecture of language is fixed and is thus identical in all languages and that whereas genes evolve languages do not. Language Complexity as an Evolving Variable reopens the debate. Geoffrey Sampson\'s introductory chapter re-examines and clarifies the notion and theoretical importance of complexity in language, linguistics, cognitive science, and evolution. Eighteen distinguished scholars from all over the world then look at evidence gleaned from their own research in order to reconsider whether languages do or do not exhibit the same degrees and kinds of complexity. They examine data from a wide range of times and places. They consider the links between linguistic structure and social complexity and relate their findings to the causes and processes of language change. Their arguments are frequently controversial and provocative; their conclusions add up to an important challenge to conventional ideas about the nature of language. The authors write readably and accessibly with no recourse to unnecessary jargon. This fascinating book will appeal to all those interested in the interrelations between human nature, culture, and language.},

Based on this, a standardized form bersama '(together) with' as created in the modern language.  In Classical Malay sama only means 'same' and bersama does not occur. The reason that you don't find sama 'with' in WOLD is because the database is for standard Indonesian, and in standard Indonesian the word for 'with' is dengan.  The word bersama is not marked as a loanword because it was created in Malay be prefixng ber- to the (borrowed) base sama.  So while sama is a loanword, bersama is not.

Buat 'make' is part of the inherited vocabulary of Malay.  The development of the meaning 'for' is much more recent, in Bazaar Malay and colloquial Indonesian.

The analysis focuses on the efforts of colonial missionaries to draw firm boundaries between Malay, the Netherlands Indies' lingua franca which later became Indonesian, and the Papuan language known as Mefoorsch. The failure of these efforts reveals the shortcomings of analyses that present 'heteroglossia' as a feature of Indies society that Dutch colonials discovered, then mastered by creating standard versions of the archipelago's many languages. Divergent ideologies not unlike those that thwarted previous generations of Protestant reformers confront today's Papuan nationalist leaders, who share a single language of unity with their foes, yet dream of making Papua into a linguistically purified space.},

 abstract = {Contrast is one of those general conceptions we all are acquainted with, everyone having particular experiences and images correlated with it. Contrast is absolutely not a linguistic term. But exactly because of its general meaning it serves best in the title of this book. Two linguistic concepts - adversativity and concessivity - are bound together by the common feature of contrast, although they are quite different in their expressions and applications in the standard versions of the four Indo-European languages investigated. Three of these languages - English, Spanish and Portuguese - are not only spoken in Europe and have undergone several particular phases of development during the last centuries, but in their basic syntactic structure they preserved the European patterns, especially in sentence connection. The fourth language, German, is the author's basis of thinking, it being her mother tongue.

The introduction will supply the reader with some information on the object. and material of investigation, beginning with the surface structure of the expressions, and completed by some notes on the terminology used here. Considerations on a more practical level have promoted the decision of presenting the tables of connectives at the very beginning. The reader may easily turn back to the tables searching for a special connective or expression. Because of the large number of contrastive connectives all general considerations and theoretical discussions will be explained by examples containing the most frequent connectives, which does not mean, however, that other connectives cannot be used in the respective case. Taking the most frequent connective as a quasi-macro-connective is widespread in the linguistic literature. But here this method will be restricted to the theoretical part, whereas the other connectives are given attention in the descriptive part based on empirical data taken from the four languages.},

 abstract = {This book is the first major cross-linguistic study of 'flexible words', i.e. words that cannot be classified in terms of the traditional lexical categories Verb, Noun, Adjective or Adverb. Flexible words can - without special morphosyntactic marking - serve in functions for which other languages must employ members of two or more of the four traditional, 'specialised' word classes. Thus, flexible words are underspecified for communicative functions like 'predicating' (verbal function), 'referring' (nominal function) or 'modifying' (a function typically associated with adjectives and e.g. manner adverbs).

Even though linguists have been aware of flexible world classes for more than a century, the phenomenon has not played a role in the development of linguistic typology or modern grammatical theory. The current volume aims to address this gap by offering detailed studies on lexical word classes, investigating their properties and what it means for the grammar of a language to have such a word class. It includes new cross-linguistic studies of word class systems as well as original descriptive and theoretical contributions from authors with an expert knowledge of languages that have played - or should play - a role in the debate about flexible word classes, including Kharia, Riau Indonesian, Santali, Sri Lanka Malay, Lushootseed, Gooniyandi, and Late Archaic Chinese.},

@book{Richards.2008,
 abstract = {in the 1970s, many cross-linguistic generalizations have been noted in the functional-typological literature, especially in such domains as person/ number marking, argument encoding by case or agreement (Silverstein 1976, Dixon 1979), diatheses and direction marking (Comrie 1981, DeLancey 1981), as well as in other domains (Keenan {\&} Comrie's (1977) Accessibility Hierarchy for relativization being a celebrated example). The formulation of scales as {\dq}implicational hierarchies{\dq} has enabled researchers in this area to formulate some of the most robust generalizations about language. More recently, the concept of scales has received considerable attention in grammatical theory as well. In particular, the work of Aissen (1999, 2003), framed within Optimality Theory (OT), has triggered a surge of research occupied with the question of how the effects of scales are related to general principles of morphosyntactic theory. Furthermore, recent work in psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theorizing has argued for cross-linguistic principles of language processing which employ the notion of a scale. The idea is that scales may help to guide incremental argument interpretation by serving to shape the interpretive relations that are established between different arguments online (Bornkessel {\&} Schlesewsky 2006).

As fruitful as this general approach has been, a number of empirical and theoretical issues surrounding the notion of scale or hierarchy remain unresolved and, indeed, the subject of some controversy. In particular, we might identify the following three groups of questions as they pertain to different areas of linguistic research:

(i) How well-established is the cross-linguistic evidence for implicational scales? Various potential counter-examples have been discussed in the recent literature (see Filimonova 2005). This question becomes especially pressing as the availability of large databases (WALS, TDS) and recent comprehensive fieldwork studies promise a better understanding of the relevant empirical generalizations. At the same time, we might ask whether there is evidence for new scales that have so far gone unnoticed. And could it be that scales are organized in a meta-hierarchy with respect to each other?

(ii) What is the status of scales in grammatical theory? Are they part of grammar itself (Noyer 1992, Aissen 1999, 2003), or are they epiphenomenal? If the latter, are they epiphenomena of (a) functionality or frequency distributions in language use (Bresnan, Dingare {\&} Manning 2001, Newmeyer 2002, Hawkins 2004, Haspelmath 2008), or (b) other grammatical mechanisms such as feature geometries and/or syntactic movement (Harley {\&} Ritter 2002, Bejar 2003)? In terms of phrase structure, we might seek to determine the relation between feature hierarchies and the order of functional projections in the syntax (Cinque 1999, Starke 2001).

(iii) What role do scales play in the language processing architecture? Should they be afforded independent status or can they be viewed as epiphenomena of other information types (e.g. frequency of occurrence)? Is there evidence for the interaction of different scales during language processing and, if so, how does this interaction take place?

These were some of the main questions that were raised and addressed by the international Workshop on Scales, organized by DFG-Forschergruppe 742 (`Grammar and Processing of Verbal Arguments'), which took place in Leipzig on March 29-30, 2008, at the Max Planck Insitute for Evolutionary Anthropology. The present volume of Linguistische Arbeits Berichte represents a selection of the papers presented at that workshop. This selection covers the full range of questions identified above, and includes not only ten contributions by members of Forschergruppe 742 but also six of the papers that were presented by invited speakers from outside the research group.},

Specifically, the study will aim at identifying the ways in which Papuan Malay speakers use person reference (person markers (pronouns), common nouns and proper nouns) in their everyday use of the language. Moreover, the study will discuss how Papuan Malay speakers use self-reference, address-reference and third party reference and why they do that. Collecting and analyzing data has revealed that the use of person reference in Papuan Malay is restricted by certain contexts. The speakers do not freely use person reference for referring or addressing, especially where people with a higher social status are concerned. This study suggests that the issue of power and politeness plays an important role in the use of person reference. Because of the power of the addressee and the referent or even the speakers themselves, the speakers avoid to use most of the person reference (especially pronouns) in non-reciprocal exchanges and to be polite, the speakers will also add kin terms before the pronouns or use other pronouns, especially plural forms, with a shift in reference.},

@incollection{Tadmor.2009,
 abstract = {Malay-Indonesian is an Austronesian language spoken in many diverse forms throughout Southeast Asia. The indigenous name of the language is Bahasa Melayu (literally, `the Malay language'), but the standard variety used in Indonesia (along with some regional colloquial varieties) is called Bahasa Indonesia (`the Indonesian language'). Similar forms of standard Malay-Indonesian serve as the national languages of Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore;2 the latter three are particularly close to each other. This chapter, unless otherwise noted, will be dealing with the most widely used variety, standard Indonesian, which will be referred to simply as `Indonesian'. Standard Malay as used in Malaysia will be referred to as `Malaysian'.

With over 250 million speakers, Malay-Indonesian is the most widely spoken language in Southeast Asia. Most speakers, however, do not acquire it as their first language. The number of native speakers is difficult to estimate; perhaps 20 per cent of the current total number of speakers acquired a colloquial variety of Malay-Indonesian as their first language. This figure is rapidly increasing, as more and more people in Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei shift from their ancestral home languages to Malay-Indonesian. As will be explained below, colloquial varieties of Malay-Indonesian exhibit a great diversity, and most are quite different from the standard variety discussed in this chapter.

Malay-Indonesian is a member of the Malayic subgroup of Western Malayo-Polynesian, a branch of the Austronesian language family. While there is wide agreement about the existence of the Malayic subgroup (and within it of Malay-Indonesian as a separate language), linguists have not been able to agree on its classification, either external or internal. Malayic used to be classified together with Javanese, Sundanese, Madurese, Acehnese and Lampung in a putative `Malayo-Javanic' branch, but strong doubts have been cast on the validity of this classification. It is now clear that Malayic is more closely related to the Chamic languages, spoken in Cambodia, Vietnam and Hainan Island (southern China), than to any of the above languages. Recent research indicates that Malayo- Chamic languages are in turn most closely related to Bali--Sasak--Sumbawan, a group of languages spoken on several islands east of Java. One factor hindering the external classification of Malayic is that many languages in the region have borrowed heavily from Malay-Indonesian, which has served as a regional lingua franca for many centuries. Similarly, no linguistic criteria have been established for distinguishing between Malayic languages and dialects of Malay-Indonesian, and there are no widely accepted subgrouping theories for either. Many scholars in the field have therefore preferred using the neutral term `isolect' to refer to any Malayic speech form which has a name of its own and is regarded by its speakers as distinct from other varieties. This practice will be followed in this chapter.

Malayic isolects vary greatly, and many of them are not mutually intelligible. They fall into several broad categories. Some, like Riau Malay (spoken in the Riau-Lingga archipelago in Indonesia) or Kedah Malay (spoken in the Malaysian state of Kedah), are thought to be direct descendants of Proto Malayic, a hypothetical language reconstructed on the basis of modern isolects. Other isolects, however, have had a more complex history, and owe their emergence to language contact and language shift. For example Betawi, the language of the indigenous ethnic group of Jakarta, is based on Malay, but has incorporated lexical and grammatical elements from Balinese, Javanese, Sundanese, Portuguese Creole and Chinese languages, which were spoken by the ancestors of today's speakers. Some isolects have developed from pidginised forms of Malay, collectively known as Bazaar Malay, which originally served only for inter-ethnic communication, not as a first language. Baba Malay, spoken by acculturated Chinese communities in Malacca, Penang and Singapore, is thought to have developed from Bazaar Malay, which gradually became the speakers' first language. Most Malayic isolects spoken in eastern Indonesia have probably also developed from early pidginised forms of Malay. This complex situation has contributed to the difficulty of classifying Malayic isolects.

Colloquial varieties of Malay-Indonesian differ greatly from each other and, as already mentioned, also from the standard language. These differences may involve any aspect: pronunciation, word formation, syntax, lexicon, semantics and pragmatics. It will of course be impossible to describe all these diverse varieties within this chapter. Therefore, as mentioned above, the description will involve mainly one variety, standard Indonesian. However, it should always be kept in mind that this is just one of a very large number of diverse varieties.},

 abstract = {This paper deal; with the type of grammatical system that for diverse reasons has been called 'ergative' in the literature, trying to elucidate one universal aspect of the structure, namely, the 'split' of case system. Data for all ergative languages show a distinction between at least two complementary configurations for indicating the grammatical function of the principal noun phrases in a sentence. In this area of grammar, traditionally called 'case-marking', we find one kind of two-way distinction usually called 'nominative-accusative', another two-way distinction which we can can 'ergative-absolutive' (or 'ergative-nominative'), and sometimes three-way distinctions which we can call 'objective-agentive-subjective' after Dixon's (1972: xxii, 128) O-A-S lettering system (especially useful for Australian languages).

'Ergative-absolutive' (or simply 'ergative') languages, by minimal definition, identify noun phrase constituents in normal active, declarative surface forms as follows: the object of a transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive are treated alike, and the subject of a transitive verb is treated differently from both of these. Contrast in (I) this ergative schema A with the schema B of 'nominative-accusative' (or simply 'accusative') languages, such as the IndoEuropean languages with which we, as speakers, are familiar.},

@article{Sigursson.2006,
 abstract = {Since Abney (1987), generative syntax has invested much interest in the structure of the Noun Phrase, producing numerous theoretical as well as descriptive studies. Within the field of Scandinavian Noun Phrase studies, Delsing (1993) was a groundbreaking work that has since been followed up by several important studies, including Vangsnes et al. (2003) and Julien (2005). This field of inquiry is enormous and largely unexplored, so, in spite of much progress, it still suffers from both too limited general understanding and much too limited knowledge of facts. This paper purports to partly improve this situation by describing the most central traits of the Icelandic noun phrase, mostly in fairly theory-neutral terms. Three phenomena are studied in particular.

First, the order of elements in the NP, partly effected by two distinct leftward (Modifer+)Noun movements, to a Spec,G(enitive) position, yielding the type `old pens her', and/or to a higher, more leftward Spec,D(eterminer) position, yielding, e.g., `old pens.the'.

Second, the adnominal genitive construction, which usually has the order Noun-Genitive, `pen her', instead of the general Germanic Genitive-Noun order, `her pen'. While the head noun in the Genitive-Noun Construction is blocked from being definite across the Germanic languages considered in this article (*`the her pen' / *`her the pen' / *`her pen.the'), this Genitive Definiteness Blocking often disappears in the Noun-Genitive Construction, which frequently either allows or requires the definite article (`pen.the her').

Third, the preproprial article, both in the Noun-Genitive Construction (`pen.the her Mary ' = `Mary's pen') and elsewhere. The plural preproprial articles (or pronouns) are of special interest, because of their rather unusual properties (`we Mary' = `Mary and I', etc.).

I illustrate in some detail that the use of both the definite article in the Noun-Genitive Construction and of the preproprial article is triggered and conditioned by fine grained semantics, suggesting that the NP may have even richer structure than often assumed.},

@incollection{Siewierska.2011,
 abstract = {Independent personal pronouns, in contrast to bound forms (i.e. clitics and affixes), are separate words capable of taking primary stress. Virtually all languages have independent personal pronouns, though in some they occur rather infrequently. Gender, as defined by Corbett (1991), is a form of classification of nominals, as shown by agreement (see Map 30A). Most gender contrasts on personal pronouns are sex-based, i.e. pronouns used for male referents are masculine and those used for females are feminine. The treatment of other referents varies. They may be referred to by a separate set (or sets) of neuter pronouns, as is the case in English and many other European languages. Alternatively, they may be grouped with the referents of masculine gender (e.g. Amharic), or less commonly with the referents of feminine gender (e.g. Warekena), or split over the masculine and feminine genders in an arbitrary way or according to some semantically based principle (e.g. Garifuna).

Gender oppositions in personal pronouns are characteristic of the third rather than the first or second person. This is suggested by Greenberg (1963: 96) Universal 44: {\dq}If a language has gender distinctions in the first person, it always has gender distinctions in the second or third person or in both{\dq}. Moreover, gender is seen as being typical of singular rather than non-singular personal pronouns. This, in turn, is expressed in Greenberg's Universal 45: {\dq}If there are any gender distinctions in the plural of the pronoun, there are some gender distinctions in the singular also{\dq}. There are some exceptions to universals 44 and 45 involving independent person pronouns, but not many (cf. especially Plank and Schellinger 1997).},

In (1), the causer (the teacher) did something, and as a result of that action the causee (Matthew) in turn carried out the action of painting the house.

The causative construction has two main characteristics. First, the causer noun phrase and the expression of cause must be foregrounded, with the causee noun phrase and the expression of effect backgrounded. The foregrounding of the causer noun phrase and the expression of cause is achieved by putting these two expressions in grammatically more prominent positions in the sentence than the causee noun phrase and the expression of effect. Second, the expression of the causer's action must be without specific meaning; all that is encoded by that expression is the pure notion of cause.},

@incollection{Seiler.1985,
 abstract = {In this paper I will be concerned with the spread of the Malay language from the Moluccas to New Guinea from the time of the early European adventurers up to the close of the 19th century. When the first Portuguese explorers arrived in the Moluccas, Malay was already known there (see for instance Bausani 1972). We know very little of the early spread of Malay from Sumatra; it is likely, however, that Malay reached the Spice Islands before the close of the first millennium. Merchant fleets of the Srividjaya empire, which had its capital near modern palembang squarely within the original Malay-speaking area, used to sail to the Moluccas and presumably spread some Malay in the process. Malay must have reached the Moluccas at the latest with the rise to power of Malacca in the 15th century. Malay served as the lingua franca in this multinational community where, according to one contemporary observer, 'very often eightyfour languages' were spoken (Pires 1944:269). While we know little enough about the early spread of Malay to the Moluccas, almost nothing is known about its further spread to New Guinea. Early Iberian exploration determined that there was trade between New Guinea and neighbouring islands (Stevens 1930:173) and that slaves were the main 'commodity' to be exported from New Guinea (Boxer and Manguin 1979:185). From the accounts of these early missions we do not gain any information about what languages were spoken in the trading situations. When more than 300 years later Australians explored the Sepik area of Papua New Guinea, they encountered many tribes who had some knowledge of Malay (see for instance McCarthy 1936-37). This is often attributed to old trading contacts between the Sepik people and Malay traders. Likewise, the Malay element in Tok Pisin is said to stem from this contact (see for instance Rowley 1965:56).

The purpose of this paper is to show first, that trade between the Moluccas and New Guinea was confined to the Bird's Head area and did not stretch to the area of modern Papua New Guinea (PNG); second, that even where trade was going on Malay did not gain a foothold before the Dutch began to actively colonise the island; third, the extent of knowledge of Malay in the Sepik area spread by bird hunters and fourth that the Malay element in Tok Pisin is not due to these bird-trading contacts but to German plantations in the old 'protectorate where Malay served as a trade language.},

The data base for this map thus includes sentences in which ownership of a certain object (the possessed item) is predicated of a possessor, in a way that is illustrated by the English sentence John has a motorcycle. It should be noted that the scope of this map is restricted by several conditions. First, the map deals only with the encoding of predicative possession, as in John has a motorcycle ; cases of adnominal possession (as in John's motorcycle ) are not dealt with. Secondly, within predicative possession it often matters whether the noun phrase that indicates the possessed item is indefinite or not. English is a language in which this parameter gives rise to two different encoding options (see 1a-b).

Word-formation processes are to a large extent rule governed, but one observes that some of these processes (or affixes) are quite often used to coin new words, whereas others are less often used or not used at all for this purpose. For example, it seems that no new noun can be formed in Modern English with the help of the suffix -th (as in depth or length), whereas the nominal suffix -ness, which is similar in function, is found very often in new formations (cf. eco-friendliness, first attested in 1989, Oxford English dictionary (OED)). In this sense, some morphological rules are called productive and other rules unproductive or less productive. Given the differences in productivity among different rules, several theoretical and empirical problems need to be addressed. First, what makes a given rule productive or unproductive? Second, how can the productivity of a given rule be measured and what mechanisms are responsible for the variability in the productivity of morphological processes? Third, should productivity be regarded as a theoretical primitive, i.e., a nonderivable property of word-formation rules, or an epiphenomenon, i.e., a property that results from other properties of the rule in question? In the following, we first look at different definitions and measurements of productivity, then turn to the psycholinguistic mechanisms influencing the productivity of word-formation rules, and finally discuss pragmatic and structural restrictions on productivity.},

@incollection{Mosel.2010,
 abstract = {Teop is an Oceanic Austronesian language of the Meso-Melanesian North-West Salomonic Group and is spoken by approximately 6000 people in Bougainville, Papua New Guinea (Ross 1988: 25, 213-228). In contrast to other Oceanic languages, Teop does not only show a large number of simple ditransitive verbs (Margetts 2007: 75), but also three productive strategies to derive ditransitive predicates: causativization, verb serialization and the incorporation of prepositions (Mosel 2007).

This paper first describes the coding and behavioural properties of the secundative and indirective constructions of bee 'give' in {\S}{\S}2-5, and then in {\S}6 presents other ditransitive root verbs and their argument realization options, i.e. recipient-theme verbs like dao 'give s.o. a name', locative-theme verbs like bavi 'rub, smear' and tasu'throw and hit, l addressee-message verbs like bivi 'ask' (but not sue 'say, tell'), and patientinstrument verbs like 'kill'. On the other hand, the transfer verbs dee 'take, bring' and vaanao 'send' are transitive in Teop. Due to limited space, the paper will only describe the constructions of ditransitive root verbs.

Since the Primary and the Secondary Object of ditransitive constructions can display a wide range of semantic roles, I prefer not to use the labels Rand T, but 01 for the Primary Object and 02 for the Secondary Object and indicate the semantic roles by subscripts, e.g. 01recp 02therne; 01!ocative 02therne, 01patient 02instr and accordingly for transitive constructions Otherne adjunctrecp etc. This labelling is also necessary because under certain conditions the theme of bee 'give' may be encoded as the Primary Object and the recipient as the Secondary Object. Speaking of the theme as R and of the recipient as T would be confusing in such cases. Since Teop is a nominative-accusative language, I do not distinguish between S and A, but label all subjects as S.

Most data used in this study come from the Teop Language Corpus (Mosel et al. 2007) which contains ca. 170 000 Teop words. In addition, a few examples come from the definitions and examples that were written by Teop native speakers for the Teop Lexical Database (Schwartz et al. 2007).},

The universal base hypotheses are the following: (1) The abstract representation of all yes-no questions includes two disjunctively connected declarative sentences, symbolizable as X or Not-X. (2) The abstract representation includes a component paraphrasable as I ASK YOU TO TELL ME. (3) For a semantic subclass of yes-no questions, those called {\dq}biased{\dq} ones, the abstract representation includes an additional declarative sentence. (4) Answers and questions are in a member-to-class relationship with each other. Eighty-five languages form the data base against which these hypotheses are tested. The structure of all yes-no questions is shown to be, on some level of representation, complex rather than simple. The underlying X or Not-X structure is shown to be subordinated to a sentence paraphrasable as I ASK YOU TO TELL ME. The underlying structure of tag questions differs from that of neutral yes-no questions since it contains an additional copy of the suggested answer. Evidence is also found to support the fourth hypothesis.},

@incollection{Mithun.1988,
 abstract = {Of all syntactic constructions, we might expect the most basic and universal to be coordination. Coordination seems so fundamental to language that its form should be relatively stable over time and constant across cultures. Yet there is surprising variety in the types of coordinating constructions exhibited by different languages, and even in the degree to which coordination is grammaticized at all. Some languages contain elaborate sets of obligatory conjunctions, some indicate syntactic links morphologically with non-finite tense or switch-reference markers, but many languages contain no grammaticized markers of coordination at all.

Does this variety mean that coordination is a language-specific strategy? Do speakers of different languages differ in the kinds of constituents they conjoin, or the occasions on which they link them? In fact, if intonation patterns are compared across languages, striking similarities emerge. Speakers of very different types of languages combine elements intonationally under essentially the same circumstances, with comparable frequency.

In what follows, the grammaticization of coordinating conjunctions will be compared across typologically diverse languages. First, patterns of coordination reflected in intonation will be compared. Next, the types of grammaticized conjunctions used to signal coordination will be surveyed, along with their diachronic sources and the processes involved in their grammaticization. Finally, the stimuli initially motivating the grammaticization of the conjunctions will be explored.},

grobak 'wheelbarrow' -- surely {\textless} BI {\_}gerobak{\_} cart, wagon; gerobak roda (...wheel) wheelbarrow (the {\dq}e{\dq} here represents schwa, often elided in common usage.

honai 'traditional.Dani hut' -- looks to me like a borrowing from some other Papuan language.

kombong 'inflated' --- Sounds like BI but not in E{\&}S

koteka 'penis sheath' --~ unfamiliar

krempeng 'thin' -- unfamiliar 

palungku or flungku 'fist --unfamiliar

pakwel 'k.o. crowbar' -- unfamiliar; sounds like Engl. {\dq}pack well{\dq}-- could it be from Melanesian Pidgin Engl.?

tiarap 'lie face downwards' -- In E{\&}S, same meaning



In addition, I have a question concerning the four items listed below. Are they roots which I should include in my analysis or should I consider the first three items as affixed with prefix ke- or preposition ke (kecuali, keluar, keliar) and the fourth one as a compound (olaraga) and therefore exclude them from my analysis.

kecuali 'except' -~*cuali does not exist in Papuan Malay -- BI uses kecuali idem (no base {\_}cuali{\_})

keluar 'go out' - luar as well as dari/di luar do exist in Papuan Malay -- BI keluar idem (deriv {\textless} luar 'outside')

keliar 'roam about' - liar 'be wild' does exist in Papuan Malay but my corpus does not include di/dari liar -- (E{\&}S separate listing) BI keliar {\textgreater} ber/keliar/an~ idem-- looks like a deriv. of liar 'wild' but not so stated.

olahraga 'do sports' - Russell lists this item as olah - raga (both parts are Malay), which implies that it is not a root but some kind of compound. Hence my question is whether I should include the item in my analysis of lexical roots. Papuan Malay only employs olaraga; the items olah or raga do not exist. -- E{\&}S list the compound {\_}olahraga{\_} sport, {\textgreater} verbal {\_}ber/olahraga{\_} engage in sports', the prefix and /h/ could easily be omitted in common usage or in the course of borrowing.

 abstract = {A conventional wisdom among creolists is that creole is a sociohistorical term only: that creole languages share a particular history entailing adults rapidly acquiring a language usually under conditions of subordination, but that structurally they are indistinguishable from other languages. The articles by John H. McWhorter collected in this volume demonstrate that this is in fact untrue.Creole languages, while complex and nuanced as all human languages are, are delineable from older languages as the result of their having come into existence only a few centuries ago. Then adults learn a language under untutored conditions, they abbreviate its structure, focusing upon features vital to communication and shaving away most of the features useless to communication that bedevil those acquiring the language non-natively. When they utilize their rendition of the language consistently enough to create a brand-new one, this new creation naturally evinces evidence of its youth: specifically, a much lower degree of the random accretions typical in older languages, which only develop over vast periods of time.The articles constitute a case for this thesis based on both broad, cross-creole ranges of data and focused expositions referring to single creole languages. The book presents a general case for a theory of language contact and creolization in which not only transfer from source languages but also structural reduction plays a central role, based on facts whose marginality of address in creole studies has arisen from issues sociopolitical as well as scientific. For several decades the very definition of the term creole has been elusive even among creole specialists. This book attempts to forge a path beyond the inter- and intra-disciplinary misunderstandings and stalemates that have resulted from this, and to demonstrate the place that creoles might occupy in other linguistic subfields, including typology, language contact, and syntactic theory.},

This paper introduces a metric of complexity, determined by degree of overt signalling of various phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and semantic distinctions beyond communicative necessity. By this metric, a subset of creole languages display less overall grammatical complexity than older languages, by virtue of the fact that they were born as pidgins, and thus stripped of almost all features unnecessary to communication, and since then have not existed as natural languages for a long enough time for diachronic drift to create the weight of {\dq}ornament{\dq} that encrusts older languages. It is demonstrated that this complexity differential remains robust even when creoles are compared with older languages lacking inflection, contra claims by theoretical syntacticians that the typology of creoles is largely a manifestation of parameter settings resulting from low inflection.

I argue that in a number of more or less familiar languages the syntax of naming constructions is such that proper names there have to be analyzed as predicates, whose content mentions the name itself (cf. ``quotation theories''). If proper names can enter syntax as predicates, then in argument positions they should have a complex structure, consisting of a determiner and its restriction, like common nouns (cf. ``definite description theories of proper names''). Further consideration of the compositional semantics of proper names in the naming construction also shows that they have another argument slot, that of the naming convention. As a result, we will be able to account for the indexicality of proper names in argument positions and provide compositional semantics of complex and modified proper names (e.g., the famous detective Sherlock Holmes).},

In contrast to the traditional portrayal of linguistic change as a natural process, M{\"u}hlh{\"a}usler focuses on the cultural and historical forces which drive language change. Using the metaphor of language ecology to explain and describe the complex interplay between languages, speakers and social practice, M{\"u}hlh{\"a}usler looks at how language ecologies have functioned in the past to sustain language diversity, and at what happens when those ecologies are disrupted.

 abstract = {The Trans New Guinea (TNG)' hypothesis, which posits a common ancestry for over 400 of the non-Austronesian languages of Melanesia and eastern Indonesia, has had a chequered career.2 It was a promising child whose birth and early growth were attended by much excitement. There followed a period when it was rejected, or at least regarded with great suspicion by most of the small band of historical linguists knowledgeable about Papuan languages. In the last few years evidence has been brought forward that strongly supports a modified version of the hypothesis.

The main discussion begins by sketching the rather complex history of the hypothesis (section 2). The first thing to note is that there is not one Trans New Guinea hypothesis but a number of variant proposals, each significantly different in scope, reflecting changes in knowledge and interpretation over the past 35 years. Four main variants will be discussed. I will assess the arguments advanced in the 1970s to support the early versions of the TNG hypothesis and will outline the reasons why the critics were unwilling to accept these arguments. In section 3 I tum to the different lines of argument and evidence that have formed the basis of a revised form of the hypothesis. Section 4 will briefly review current views of the internal relationships of the languages assigned to the TNG family. The chapter will end with a consideration of several thorny questions: Where was proto TNG spoken and when did it break up? What circumstances enabled the TNG languages to spread over many areas of New Guinea while preventing them from occupying others?},

@article{Parker.2008,
 abstract = {A long-standing controversy in the interface between phonetics and phonology involves the nature of sonority: does it even exist and, if so, what are its phonetic correlates, and how can this be empirically demonstrated? This paper seeks to help resolve this problem by providing physical evidence supporting the sonority hierarchy. This is accomplished by reporting the results of a rigorous experiment measuring sound levels of realizations of all phonemes in English, Spanish, and Quechua. The obtained intensity values yield an overall mean Spearman's correlation of .91 with the proposed sonority indices. Consequently, one possible way to informally characterize sonority is in terms of a linear regression equation based on the observed intensity results. In light of these findings, the frequent claim that sonority lacks a reliable phonetic basis can no longer be maintained.

The best argument for this view centers on [continuant] and facts of nasal place assimilation - in particular, instances of nasal place assimilation to fricatives, where the nasal appears to remain a stop. However, a closer look at nasal place assimilation provides a strong argument against this standard view: across languages, place assimilation to fricatives is highly disfavored in comparison to assimilation to stops, and occurring nasal-fricative clusters behave like affricates. I show how a theory in which [continuant] is place-dependent can explain these facts, exploiting the notion of structure preservation. The treatment of stricture proposed brings feature geometry more in line with models based on facts of phonetics and vocal tract anatomy, e.g., the gestural model of Browman and Goldstein.},

@misc{Paauw.2013,
 abstract = {The Malay language has been a lingua franca in insular Southeast Asia for at least a millennium, and quite likely for much longer. Trade in spices which originated in the islands of eastern Indonesia---primarily cloves and nutmeg---fed into a trade network which stretched to the Middle East and Europe centuries before Europeans first appeared in the archipelago. The language used to conduct this trade was Malay, which was used as a language of wider communication as far afield as the Philippines, New Guinea and Australia for hundreds of years. Malay was particularly well--suited for this purpose, due to its {\dq}undressed{\dq} morphology and isolating nature.

In various locations in eastern Indonesia, varieties of Malay emerged in the centuries before European contact, initially as trade languages for limited purposes, but eventually becoming the native languages of populations in these regions. These eastern Indonesian contact varieties of Malay continue to expand today, although they are under threat from regional varieties of colloquial Indonesian. A number of these varieties were well--established when Europeans first arrived in the early 16th century, and they may have existed as long as 1000 years ago (Blust 1988:8).

This study is concerned with seven of the Malay contact varieties of eastern Indonesia: Manado Malay in northern Sulawesi, North Moluccan Malay in the northern Moluccas islands, Ambon Malay and Banda Malay in the central Moluccas, Kupang Malay in western Timor island, and Papua Malay in the Indonesian half of New Guinea1(see Figure 1). These varieties have become the native languages for at least some portion of their communities, and most are also used as languages of wider communication in their regions. There are other Malay varieties in eastern Indonesia which may also fit these conditions, notably Makassar Malay and Alor Malay.},

@phdthesis{Paauw.2009,
 abstract = {This dissertation is about the varieties of Malay in eastern Indonesia which have arisen through language contact as a result of trade and colonial policies over the past 500-1000 years. Seven varieties have been identified which have become the native languages of their communities. These seven varieties are Manado Malay (North Sulawesi), North Moluccan Malay (North Moluccas), Ambon Malay and Banda Malay (Central Moluccas), Kupang Malay (Timor), Larantuka Malay (Flores) and Papua Malay (Indonesian New Guinea).

The seven varieties are decribed and compared, using a typological framework, looking at their phonology, general structure and clause structure, nouns and noun phrases, verbs and verb phrases and other grammatical features. The similarities and differences between the varieties in terms of each feature are discussed, and innovations are noted. In addition, a grammatical sketch of each variety, based upon the typological analysis presented in the dissertation, is included in Appendix 1.

The description and comparison of the seven varieties is based upon data collected during field work in seven locations in eastern Indonesia in 2003 and 2007. These data are included in Appendix 2. These data are supplemented by data found in published and unpublished descriptions of these varieties, where available.

Based upon the descriptions and comparisons of the varieties, conclusions are drawn regarding the historical origins and developments of the seven varieties. The Malay contact varieties of eastern Indonesia are thought to have developed from Vehicular Malay, an undocumented historical trade language which brought the Malay language to eastern Indonesia from the Malay homeland in western Indonesia. Features shared by the eastern Indonesian contact varieties and western Indonesian varieties of Malay can be attributed to the historical Vehicular Malay language, and these features are described in the conclusion of this dissertation. In addition, features which are shared between the Malay contact varieties of eastern Indonesia but which are not found in western Indonesia are evidence that at one time, there was a single variety spoken in eastern Indonesia from which the seven Malay contact varieties of eastern Indonesia are descended. The features which can be ascribed to this variety are presented, and this previously undefined and unknown variety is given the name Eastern Indonesia Trade Malay (EITM). It is shown that the seven Malay contact varieties described in this dissertation are descended from EITM, and a likely pattern of the spread of these varieties is presented. Furthermore, it is noted that one variety, Larantuka Malay, spoken on the eastern tip of the island of Flores, in addition to many features derived from EITM, also has a significant component derived from

peninsular Malay, which can be attributed to known historical factors.

In addition to features attributable to Vehicular Malay and EITM, there are some features which are unique to a single variety or which are shared by a few varieties which can be attributed to substrate influence.

This dissertation provides important information regarding the historical development of the contact Malay varieties of eastern Indonesia, as well as providing a typological description of these varieties. Furthermore, in view of the fact that these varieties are threatened by the expansion of the national language, Indonesian, which is being used in an increasing number of domains, the descriptions of these languages is an important step in documenting endangered language varieties.},

@phdthesis{Mattes.2007,
 abstract = {This dissertation is a study of reduplication in general and a description of the types of reduplication in Bikol (bcl), a Central-Philippine language, in particular. Reduplication has always attracted the attention of linguists, perhaps especially because speakers of Indo-European languages are not familiar with the phenomenon, but they can find it in almost every non-Indo-European language. Among the many languages which make use of reduplication, the Philippine languages are known to do so to an outstanding degree. The first impression that one gets by looking at the morphology of Philippine languages is that reduplication can exercise almost all functions and that the operation can be applied nearly without any restrictions. This might be seen as one of the many challenges that Philippine languages pose to the universality of grammar.

Although the extensive use of reduplication with its wide range of different forms and meanings is often cited to be a characteristic feature of Austronesian languages, and although there are some compilations of reduplication types for some of these languages, grammars of Austronesian languages usually do not provide any detailed analysis or explanation of the reduplication system. This dissertation on reduplication in Bikol aims to exemplify a detailed study of one specific reduplication system of one language. To this end it makes use of insights gained from cross-linguistic research, and it pays back its dues, since the much more detailed insights into a specific system undoubtedly enrich the typological results and structural knowledge of reduplication in general.},

kecuali 'except'. Unless you have a word cuali (which I doubt very much), you can't say this has more than one morpheme. Think of silly in English; it looks like it has two morphemes, sil and -ly, but since sil doesn't exist (SIL still does$\ldots$), it's simply a single morpheme.



keluar 'go out'. In Standar Malay this is in opposition with di luar, mengeluarkan etc., so there you have a clear root luar. The verb keluar is - at least historically - a prepositional phrase which has grammaticalised (changed category and become a unit) into a verb. Does PM also have di luar? If so, you can maybe call keluar a frozen compound of ke- and luar.



keliar 'roam about'. I only know this in berkeliaran. The relationship with liar 'wild' is likely, but the meaning has specialised and the combination of preposition ke with adjective liar is strange. Don't know.



Finally, concerning olahraga, Russell lists this item as 'olah' - 'raga', which implies that it is not a root but some kind of compound. What do you think? Historically and in SM, yes, it's a compound (raga refers to either a rattan ball or to the body). Syncronically it's almost certainly just a single morpheme. Unless you have evidence in PM that both olah and raga function independently as words, treat this word as a unit.},

 abstract = {Malay, a member of the Malayic language group, belongs to the subfamily of the western Malayo- Polynesian languages of the Austronesian language family. Other Malayic variants that have Proto- Malayic as their common ancestor include Minangkabau, Kerinci, Banjar, Iban, and Jakarta Malay (Adelaar, 1992). Northwestern Borneo is thought to be the homeland of the speakers of the protolanguage (Adelaar, 1995; Nothofer, 1997; Collins, 1998). About 2000 years ago some of them migrated to eastern Sumatra, while others remained behind and stayed in northwestern Borneo. Some of the latter traveled south to Ketapang and then crossed over to Bangka and Belitung (Nothofer, 1997). Those remaining in the homeland area are the ancestors of speakers of Malayic Dayak languages (e.g., Iban, Selako). The Malays who sailed to Sumatra settled the island's east coast. Some moved on into the interior and to the west coast of southern Sumatra. While Middle Malay, Minangkabau, and Kerinci have inland and west coast variants as their origin, Malay itself developed from isolects spoken on the east coast. Later, Malay speakers from the southeast coast of Sumatra established Malay colonies in the Malay Peninsula. Other Malays returned to west Borneo, where they settled the coastal and riverine areas. The isolects spoken by these relatively recent migrants differ considerably from the isolects of Malays who never left Borneo. Coastal Borneo has other Malay isolects such as Sarawak Malay, Brunei Malay, Kutai Malay, and Banjjar, perhaps as a result of a clockwise settlement that originated in western Borneo (Figure 1).},

Psychologists have long been interested in words (much more so than in sentences, traditionally) and the ways in which people use and process them. Recently, workers in cognitive psychology have developed reliable techniques for investigating the semantic, phonological, and orthographic structures of words, as well as the ways in which people process these structures.

One of these techniques is known as the lexical-decision task. In this task, people are required to judge whether various stimuli are instances of English words or not. Both the decision (yes or no) and the time taken to reach the decision provide data for testing hypotheses about linguistic structures and the psychological processes that represent and use these structures. Several recent experiments have used the lexical-decision task to investigate the role of lingusitic structure in recognizing words and nonwords.},

It starts with a general picture of the uniqueness of languages and cultures in Papua: its geography, the originality of the people, and the languages and cultures of both NAN and AN. The word {\dq}Papua{\dq} (used to be called Irian Jaya) in the above title is the name of the Eastern Province in Indonesia. The article further presents ongoing controversial issues on the impact of linguistic and cultural diversity in Papua towards the educational development including the TEFL program in this province. It then provides alternative solutions as reflected in the pedagogical implications to be employed in multicultural classrooms particularly in Papua.},

@incollection{Anderson.1985,
 abstract = {Following standard usage, we consider as deictic expressions (or deictics for short) those linguistic elements whose interpretation in simple sentences makes essential reference to properties of the extralinguistic context of the utterance in which they occur. Given the sentence John loves me, for example, we cannot tell who is being loved unless we know who is uttering the sentence. Me is thus a deictic - its referent is understood of necessity to be the person who utters or asserts the sentence in which it appears.

The principal kinds of information which are expressed by deictics in lan-guage are: (i) Person, (ii) Spatial location, and (iii) Time reference. (Grammatical) person deictics are expressions which make essential reference to the speaker (Sp) or the addressee (Adr) of the utterance; spatial deictics are items which specify the spatial location of an object relative to the location of the Sp or the Adr; and temporal deictics are expressions which identify the time of an event or state relative to the time at which the utterance occurs. Thus, in the utterance Did you write this yesterday? the pronoun you is a person deictic, since it refers to the Adr; the demonstrative this is a spatial deictic, since it refers to something whose location is described by reference to the spatial location of the Sp; and the adverb yesterday is a temporal deictic, since it refers to a time one day prior to the day on which the sentence is uttered. The past tense form did is also a temporal deictic, since it , specifies the time of writing as prior to that at which the utterance occurs.

In this chapter, we are primarily concerned with specifying in more detail the variety of linguistic forms which deictic expressions may take, and the variety of kinds of person, spatial, and temporal information which may be systematically structured by such forms. Our interest is less in the formal mechanisms by which deictic elements are expressed than in the types of system which are found in natural languages. For some discussion of the former issue, see chapters III:3 and I:I.

We also limit our attention primarily to items which are deictic when used in (what we naively determine to be) simple sentences. We can note, however, that many items which are deictic in simple sentences cease to be interpreted deictically when they appear in various types of complex structure. For example, the past tense in He was sick is deictic, since it refers to an event or state which obtained prior to time of the utterance. When the same tense marking occurs in John will say that he was sick (said for example as an attempt to anticipate John's excuse for not having attended some meeting in the future), however, we interpret the state as past merely with regard to the time of John's speaking, not with regard to that of the utterance. We refer to this phenomenon as relative (or relativized) deixis, and will return to it in the final section of this chapter.},

@article{Bybee.2006,
 abstract = {A usage-based view takes grammar to be the cognitive organization of one's experience with language. Aspects of that experience, for instance, the frequency of use of certain constructions or particular instances of constructions, have an impact on representation that is evidenced in speaker knowledge of conventionalized phrases and in language variation and change. It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances under the pressure of newer formations. An exemplar model that accommodates both phonological and semantic representation is elaborated to describe the data considered.},

A very large number of languages make use of phonemic ŋ, while many others lack this sound. However, few of the sounds commonly found among the phonemic inventories of the world's languages exhibit a more clearly definable distribution than that exhibited by ŋ. This distribution has two unrelated aspects. One is the striking areal distribution of the presence vs. absence of phonemic ŋ among the languages of the world. The other striking aspect of phonemic ŋ is its phonotactic distribution: in many languages possessing this sound, it may not appear in all positions in the word, but rather is restricted to initial, medial, or final position, or some combination thereof. In the case of restriction of ŋ to non-initial position, this, too, has a relatively pronounced areal skewing among the world's languages.},

 abstract = {This chapter deals with patterns of word-formation, their classification and parameters of cross-linguistic variation. Grammatical words (section 1) in most languages have an internal structure; the typological parameters which account for their cross-linguistic variation are discussed in section 2. Word-formation processes correlate with syntax in different ways depending on language type. One such word-formation process -- known as `the most nearly syntactic of all' (Mithun (1984)) -- is noun incorporation, discussed in section 3.

The structure of words in a language can be more or less iconically motivated (see section 4). Word-formation, traditionally, falls into compounding and derivation. A compound consists of morphemes which could be free (see section 5), while derivation involves the use of different classes of bound morphemes and of morphological processes to form words (see section 6). Word-formation processes vary in terms of their productivity -- see section 7. Word-formation processes are prone to distinct patterns of grammaticalization and lexicalization -- see section 8. A brief summary is given in section 9, and in section 10 I provide suggestions for field workers describing word-formation in previously undocumented or poorly documented languages.},

 abstract = {The term nominalization means in essence `turning something into a noun' (see vol. i, chapter 1, for the internal and contextual characterization of `noun'). In this chapter we will be concerned both with what forms can turn into nouns and with what kinds of nouns result from these operations.

The organization of this chapter, then, will be as follows: section 1 will be a discussion of derivational devices that create nouns from lexical verbs and adjectives. The resulting nouns may be the name of the activity or state designated by the verb or adjective, or may represent one of its arguments. Thus, we may categorize nominalizations as follows:

A Name of activity or state

1 action/state nouns

B Name of an argument

2 agentive nouns

3 instrumental nouns

4 manner nouns

5 locative nouns

6 objective nouns

7 reason nouns

As we shall see, the difference between the forms in class A and those in class B is that the A forms retain certain properties of the verbs or adjectives they are related to, while those in B typically behave syntactically like other nouns in the language, bearing only morphological and (often unpredictable and idiosyncratic) semantic relations to the associated verb or adjective. Section 2 will be a somewhat more lengthy treatment of devices by which entire predicates and propositions can be turned into noun phrases; included there will be a discussion of the types of devices found, the verbal and nominal categories represented in the nominalization, the syntactic collocations of action nominals, and the functions of such nominalizations. Section 3 will briefly take up nouns derived from nouns, and section 4 summarizes the discussion.},

Fokusnya adalah abad 18-20 di mana Pemerintah Belanda mulai beralih dari misi perdagangan kepada misi politik, usaha-usahanya untuk menjadikan Tanah Papua sebagai wilayah koloninya. Pembahasan lebih khusus akan dicurahkan perhatian pada pertengahan abad 20 di mana terjadi perebutan kekuasaan atas Tanah Papua antara Pemerintah Belanda dan Indonesia sehingga membawa kedua bangsa tersebut ke meja perundingan intemasional. Selain memberi perhatian pada usaha-usaha dekolonisasi Belanda di Tanah Papua untuk memberikan kemerdekaan kepada orang Papua, akan dibahas pula kekuasaan Indonesia selama Orde Lama dan dekade pertama masa Orde barn; sebab orang Papua tabu dan mengalami bahwa kolonisasi di bawah kekuasaan Indonesia jauh lebih kejam, lebih biadab, dan tak berperikemanusiaan ketimbang perlakuan pada masa kolonisasi Belanda terhadap orang Papua.

Are they roots which I should include in my analysis or should I consider the first three items as affixed with prefix ke- or preposition ke (kecuali, keluar, keliar) and the fourth one as a compound (olaraga) and therefore exclude them from my analysis. 



kecuali 'except' - *cuali does not exist in Papuan Malay [nor does it exist as a separate morpheme in Indonesian / Malay



keluar 'go out' - luar as well as dari/di luar do exist in Papuan Malay [straightforwardly 2 morphemes]



keliar 'roam about' - liar 'be wild' does exist in Papuan Malay but my corpus does not include di/dari liar 

seems to be semantically too distinct from liar to be related, except historically, so one morpheme, also found in Malay/Indonesian



olahraga 'do sports' - Russell lists this item as olah - raga (both parts are Malay), which implies that it is not a root but some kind of compound. Hence my question is whether I should include the item in my analysis of lexical roots. Papuan Malay only employs olaraga; the items olah or raga do not exist. 

[in that case I would say that it is a lexical root in Papuan Malay; the morphemic structure in other Malays is irrelevant]},

 abstract = {'Markedness' refers to the tendency of languages to show a preference for particular structures or sounds. This bias towards 'marked' elements is consistent within and across languages, and tells us a great deal about what languages can and cannot do. This pioneering study presents a groundbreaking theory of markedness in phonology. De Lacy argues that markedness is part of our linguistic competence, and is determined by three conflicting mechanisms in the brain: (a) pressure to preserve marked sounds ('preservation'), (b) pressure to turn marked sounds into unmarked sounds ('reduction'), and (c) a mechanism allowing the distinction between marked and unmarked sounds to be collapsed ('conflation'). He shows that due to these mechanisms, markedness occurs only when preservation is irrelevant. Drawing on examples of phenomena such as epenthesis, neutralisation, assimilation, vowel reduction and sonority-driven stress, Markedness offers an important insight into this essential concept in the understanding of human language.},

Dr Bhat argues that these words do not form a single category, but rather two different categories called 'personal pronouns' and 'proforms'. He points out several differences between the two, such as the occurrence of a dual structure among proforms but not among personal pronouns. These differences are shown to derive from the distinct functions that the two categories have to perform in language.

The book also shows that the so-called interrogative pronouns of familiar languages are less concerned with interrogation than with indefiniteness. The author shows that the notion of indefiniteness that can be associated with these and other pronouns is quite different from the one that can be associated with noun phrases. He goes on to postulate certain typological distinctions such as 'two-person' and 'three-person' languages and 'free-pronoun' and 'bound-pronoun' languages.},

This can be understood as a universal correlation between the odds of overt case marking and scale ranks (a negative correlation for subjects, a positive one for objects), or as an implicational universal proposing that, if a language has a split in case marking, this split fits a universal scale. We tested both claims with various versions of scale definitions against a sample of over 350 case systems worldwide, controlling for confounding factors of genealogical and areal relationships. We find no statistical evidence for a universal correlation that is independent of family membership and has any appreciable predictive power. Formulated as an implicational universal, we find that there are only few areally independent families that show a trend towards fitting scales, and that each family fits different scales. What we do find, by contr ast, is a strong area effect: once genealogical relationships are controlled for, differential argument marking shows a frequency peak in Eurasia and nowhere else. We conclude that the currently available empirical evidence is too weak to reject the null hypothesis that splits in case marking develop through individual diachronic changes -- such as innovations of case morphology in nouns but not pronouns (Filimonova, 2005), reanalyses of instrumentals as ergatives on inanimates (Garrett, 1990), contact-induced calquing of definite vs. indefinite contrasts by means of case marking, or other idiosyncracies.},

A claim that the North Sarawak languages form part of a larger North Borneo group that includes the indigenous languages of Sabah has been in circulation since Blust (1974b), and was further elaborated in Blust (1998). Despite this claim, both the North Sarawak and North Borneo hypotheses have received scant attention in broader discussions of Austronesian subgrouping, which sometimes stress the absence of well-established large subgroups in western Indonesia (Ross 1995: 72). A number of proposed lexical innovations suggest that North Borneo is part of a still larger group that incorporates Malayo-Chamic, Moken, Rejang, Sundanese, and all other languages of Borneo except the Barito family. This wider group, which notably excludes Madurese, Balinese, and Sasak, is called {\dq}Greater North Borneo.{\dq} Although it is not the primary focus of this paper, there is additional evidence that Greater North Borneo forms part of a more encompassing {\dq}Western Indonesian{\dq} subgroup that includes all Austronesian languages of mainland Southeast Asia, Madagascar, and the Greater Sunda Islands, but not the languages of Sulawesi.},

Although the emphasis is different, the proposal offered here thus has fundamental similarities with Alderete (1997) in arguing that where it applies to dissimilation the Obligatory Contour Principle is inseparably connected with marked elements. Its primary contributions are to provide further empirical support for this claim that may not be readily accessible to non-specialists, to generalise the claim to a larger class of data, to suggest that the explanation for such patterns may be cognitive rather than phonetic and particularly to draw attention to conditions under which markedness-triggered dissimilation is suppressed.},

@incollection{Baayen.1992,
 abstract = {Research into the phenomenon of morphological productivity, {\dq}the possibility for language users to coin, unintentionally, a number of formations which are in principle uncountable{\dq} (Schultink 1961), has mainly focused on the qualitative factors which jointly determine the productivity of word formation rules. It is well known that word formation processes are subject to various syntagmatic conditions. Booij (1977) develops a typology of such conditioning factors, distinguishing between rule-specific and rule-independent restrictions on the one hand, and between restrictions pertaining to phonological, stratal and syntactic characteristics on the other. I The role of pardigmatic factors is discussed in van Marie (1985). He points out that (roughly) synonymous affixes tend to select their base words from complementary domains. Hence they can be analyzed as mutually affecting their respective degrees of productivity.

Other kinds of conditioning factors involved are semantic coherence and contextual appropriateness. The importance of semantic coherence is stressed by Aronoff (1976). He shows that there is a direct link between semantic coherence and productivity. The words generated by the more productive rules are semantically highly predictable, formations covered by the less productive and unproductive rules are often characterized by various unpredictable readings. When complex words assume such diverse meanings that the core meaning of the morphological category becomes opaque, this may cause speakers to become uncertain as to the semantic function of the corresponding word formation rule, with the effect that they are less likely to use it. Van Marie (1988) argues that the Dutch suffix -lijk, as in waarlijk 'truly', has lost its productivity in precisely this way.

The role of contextual appropriateness is explicitly taken into account in the version of Coseriu's (1970, 1975) theory of 'System, Norm und Rede' developed by Burgschmidt (1977). Burgschmidt discusses the phenomenon that the extent of use of well-formed complex items is a function of the social context. For instance, while rentenempfangberechtigt 'pensionable' is acceptable in the context of official language, the use of suppenempfangberechtigt 'entitled to receiving soup' in the family circle is ridiculous. With respect to derivation, we may mention the Dutch suffix -erd, which is used to coin slightly pejorative personal names in Dutch such as bangerd and dikkerd from bang 'afraid' and dik 'fat', respectively. Interestingly, this suffix shows up with only seven types in the written language of the Eindhoven corpus (henceforth EC), a corpus of some 600 000 word forms. Even though -erd is judged to be productive (see e.g. Schultink 1962: 200-205), it is not extensively used in written language, which usually requires a more formal style in which such formations are inappropriate. In other words, for a word formation rule to be fully productive, it should be appropriate in a sufficiently broad range of styles. In fact, speech style is but one of a number of nonlinguistic factors which may codetermine the productivity of word formation rules, such as the socio-economic status of the language user, his or her attitude towards the morphological processes of the language,2 and the pragmatic factor of the usefulness of the concepts associated with the complex words generated by a given rule. For instance, van Santen and de Vries (1981) argue that the absence in dictionaries of Dutch of many formations in the productive suffix -ster, which forms female personal nouns, is due to the low pragmatic usefulness of such female personal names.3 In what follows, I will use the expression 'extent of use' to refer to the combined effects of these various non-linguistic factors on the 'global productivity' of word formation rules, that is, the overall productivity as the outcome of the interaction of linguistic and non-linguistic factors.

The notion of morphological productivity has received considerable clarification from the study of the various kinds of restrictions which have been found to condition word formation rules. In a qualitative sense, the productivity of a word formation rule can be said to be inversely proportional to the number of conditioning factors in force (Booij 1977). Nevertheless, the quantitative outcome of the interaction of the - often highly heterogeneous - conditioning factors has remained rather obscure. The aim of the present paper is to clarify some of the issues involved in the quantification of morphological productivity. In Section 2 three complementary measures of morphological productivity are developed, which make use of the statistical information contained in the empirical frequency distributions of morphological categories in text corpora. Section 3 relates our findings to the theory of the mental lexicon, and Section 4 reviews three models in which the relevance of token frequencies is recognized, the models developed by Anshen and Aronoff (1988), Bybee (1985, 1988) and Rumelhart and McClelland (1986).},

The chapters also provide access to more detailed studies of Dutch that have appeared in the international literature. This book shows that the morphology of Dutch poses many interesting descriptive and theoretical challenges, and that its detailed analysis can contribute to ongoing theoretical discussions on the nature of word formation processes, the relation between syntagmatic and paradigmatic structure, rule-base versus constraint-based grammar, and the interface between morphology, phonology, syntax, and semantics. The book will be of relevance to students of Germanic languages, general linguists, typologists, computational linguists, and psycholinguists.},

The guava is a New World plant, introduced into the Philippines by the Spanish in the 16th century (Spanish guayaba).~ Like many other Spanish nouns, it was borrowed in its plural form, as Tagalog /bayabas/.~ This then spread southward into Malay, where it underwent the regular sound change of *aba {\textgreater} -awa, to yield Malay /biawas/.~ Loanwords often show sporadic changes, and in this case it looks like the original g- went to b- and then back to g- in the borrowing process (since -w- identifies it as a form acquired through Malay).

Spanish has /guayaba/, /guayaba-s/, which was borrowed by Tagalog as /bayabas/ (-s reanalyzed as part of the base).~ Malay borrowed the Tagalog form as /biawas/, with three regular by very~narrowly conditioned sound changes: (1) *a to schwa in the antepenult, (2) deletion of schwa before a vowel or glide (with vocalization of *byabas to *biabas, and (3) *b to /w/ only /a{\_}{\_}a (we have 4-5 examples of this change, which is very distinctive).~ 

The fact that Papuan Malay has /giawas/ with -/w/- is an almost certain indication that it derives from Malay, not from Spanish.~ The initial stops of loanwords are highly irregular and variable, as seen in Spanish /papaya/, /papaya-s/, but Pangasinan /apayas/, Tagalog /papaya/, Bikol /tapayas/, Western Bukidnon Manobo /kepayas/, Yakan /kapaya/ ~'papaya'.~ What is distinctive (and indicative of probable historical connection) here, is the -w-, not the g-~in /giawas/.},

@misc{EmbassyoftheRepublicofIndonesiainLondon.2009,
 abstract = {Introduction

With a population of 200 million, Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation on earth. Although comprised of more than 17,500 islands in an archipelago stretching 5,000 kilometers across Southeast Asia, Indonesia is a crowded country. Indonesia's islands are richly endowed with great diversity of natural resources, including abundant arable land, yet 59 percent of the population inhabits the island of Java. Indonesia's rapid industrialization led to the growth of vast urban areas, especially on overcrowded Java. Transmigrasi or transmigration is Indonesia's voluntary program for restoring a more even distribution of population to the country and is an important element in the nation's development as a modern economy. The goal of the program is to improve the lives of poor and landless families and to develop Indonesia's many underpopulated islands by offering land and jobs to people who have neither. The voluntary resettlement program enables people to move from the three most densely populated islands ofJava, Bali, and Madura to more sparsely populated and less-developed areas, including Sulawesi, Kalimantan, and Irian Jaya.

The Land

Indonesia's political and economic development has been influenced by its location at the crossroads of important historical trade routes connecting the Middle East and Asia. Formerly known as the Netherlands East Indies, Indonesia proclaimed its independence from the Netherlands in 1945 and adopted a constitution. The thousands of islands that comprise the Republic of Indonesia extend across the equator, between Malaysia and the Philippines to the north and Australia to the south. The country is divided into 33 provinces, including Jakarta, the capital and largest city, situated on the northern coast of West Java.

The Resources

Indonesia's geography, natural resources and economic and trade policies have enabled the country to sustain strong, long-term economic growth. Manufacturing has grown rapidly in recent years, and since 1991, has been Indonesia's major economic sector, followed by agriculture. The third largest economic sector .is wholesale and retail trade. Mining and quarrying constitute the fourth largest economic sector.

Indonesia ranks 15th among world oil producers, and eighth among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members. Indonesia is the only Asian OPEC nation. Indonesia is also the world's largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), accounting for over 40 percent of the world market and is the world's seventh largest producer of natural gas. Indonesia's major export markets for crude oil are Japan and the United States.

In the mining sector in addition to crude oil and liquefied natural gas Indonesia exports significant quantities of copper ore, nickel matte, coal and aluminium. Significant deposits of gold have also been discovered on several Indonesian islands. Indonesia is also the world's largest tin producer, recently surpassing Brazil and Malaysia. Mining exports accounted for almost eight percent of total exports in 1995, more than five times the {\$}503 million, or two percent value, of total exports in 1990. Since 1983, the Government of Indonesia has carried out a series of broad measures aimed at reducing its reliance on oil revenues through the development of a more diversified and competitive economy. The Government continues to take measures to reform the economy, promote investment, increase non-oil exports and expand the tourism industry and capital markets. The economy has responded well, with strong growth in non-oil exports. In 1984, oil and gas contributed up to 80 percent of export earnings and 70 percent of government revenues. By 1995, these figures were cut to 23 and 19 percent, respectively. In addition, the value of approved foreign investment has increased significantly, reaching {\$}40 billion in 1995, four times that of 1992.

Industrial Progress

In manufactured and industrial exports, Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of plywood, with annual sales of over {\$}3.46 billion; a major producer of textiles and apparel, with annual sales of {\$}6.2 billion; and a growing exporter of footwear and electric apparatus, with rapidly growing annual sales of {\$}4 billion. Other products include furniture, cement, fertilizer, steel and glassware. Indonesia is the world's second-largest producer of rubber, the third-largest producer of coffee, the leading single source of rattan, and a major producer of palm oil, spices and essential oils. Through the introduction of new rice strains and the Government's efforts at improving and expanding irrigation systems, Indonesia, which in 1975 was the world's largest importer of rice, became a net exporter in 1984. In the high technology arena, Indonesia has the most sophisticated aircraft industry in Southeast Asia. Indonesian Aircraft Industries, produces small, fixed-wing aircraft that are sold to buyers around the world. Other aviation exports include aircraft parts, helicopters and engines. Besides the aircraft industry, Indonesia has a growing range of automotive and electronic production capabilities.

Indonesia is embarking on an ambitious program to expand and modernize its telecommunications network and will install at least five million new lines by the end of Repelita VI. In addition, Indonesia will develop about 600,000 cellular lines, expected to be in operation by the end of the decade. Electronic goods are manufactured for domestic as well as export markets.

International Relations

Indonesia plays an important role in global affairs while also embracing its responsibility to its millions of citizens whose primary right is an opportunity to continue improving their quality of life and that of future generations. Indonesia's principal trading partners include Japan, the United States, members of the European Community and the other nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). ASEAN has been extremely successful in its efforts to promote economic, social, cultural and scientific relations between its members.

Indonesia is also fully committed to its obligations to the World Trade Organization and that group's goal of encouraging an open and fair multilateral trading system and transparent laws and regulations governing national economies. Indonesia's commitment to a global economy is also reflected in its leadership in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference (APEC), a grouping of Pacific Rim countries. As host of the second Leader's meeting, Indonesia was able to promote agreement on the Bogor Declaration, which aims to establish free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region by the beginning of the 21st Century.

Politically, Indonesia has adopted an increasingly important international role. It co-chaired the Cambodian peace process, and as Chair of the Non-Aligned Movement has chartered a course for that organization, which aims to move from the traditionally confrontational North/South divisiveness to mutually beneficial cooperation. Indonesia supports the Middle East Peace Process and has played a vital role in United Nations peacekeeping operations, including those following the Arab-Israeli War, the Vietnam War and more recently, in Bosnia and Somalia.

Indonesia has also taken the lead in maintaining regional stability, including participating in the ASEAN Regional Forum, which focuses on security; brokering a peace agreement between the Philippine Government and the Moro National Liberation Front, ending decades-long conflict there; and as part of efforts to support nuclear non-proliferation, contributing to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO).

Improving Social Services

The Government of Indonesia has emphasized education as an important factor in social and economic development. As a result of the Government's efforts in mass education, with expenditures representing between 12 and 18 percent of the country's annual budget, the literacy rate of the population has increased steadily. According to estimates following the October 1990 census, the literacy rate of the urban population is 90.5 percent and that of the rural population is 77.4 percent.

The Indonesian Government as well as local communities operate health facilities throughout the country. Recent figures indicate that Indonesia has approximately 1,700 hospitals with a total of 121,700 hospital beds. In addition, there are some 27,800 community health centers and approximately 27,900 practicing doctors in Indonesia. The average life expectancy in Indonesia has risen dramatically, from 41 years in 1965 to 63 years in 1994, while infant mortality rates have plummeted.

Indonesia has implemented an extremely successful National Family Planning Program, a voluntary plan based on education, health awareness, community involvement and contraceptive choice. The program stresses the benefits of limiting family size to two children. It has been one of the most effective of its kind in the world and has helped ease the burden of population growth on the country's developing economy.

Measuring Results

Indonesia's political system has produced a government that has brought a quarter-century of unprecedented prosperity and peace. In just 2 5 years, Indonesia's per capita income has risen from only {\$}70 to approximately {\$}1,000; the poverty rate has plummeted from over 60 percent to 11 percent; life expectancy has risen from 45 to 63 years; and the economy has grown at a rate of seven percent annually over the past ten years. Indonesia's middle class has expanded to the tens of millions, larger than the entire population of neighboring Australia. The country has successfully made the transformation from an agrarian economy, based on commodities and raw materials, to a dynamic and diversified economic structure. In addition, through a restrictive monetary policy and a conservative fiscal stance, the Government has confined annual inflation to the five to ten percent range in the last five years. Current government policy is aimed not only at sustaining this progress, but at increasing it.},

@article{deVries.2005,
 abstract = {In this article a typological overview of tail--head linkage (THL) in Papuan languages is presented. There are two types of THL, chained THL and thematized THL. The chained type is the default type and its morphosyntactic form follows from the basic clause linkage type in a given Papuan language, for example when switch reference constructions are the basic type of clause linkage, then the default type of THL takes the form of switch reference constructions. Chained THL carries referential coherence mechanisms (e.g. gender agreements, switch reference) and event sequencing mechanisms (e.g. sequence-simultaneity morphology) across chain boundaries. The second, marked, type of THL is with nominalized clauses that discontinue the event and participant lines. The head clause in this type of THL is a thematic NP that is syntactically separate from the chain and this reflects thematic discontinuity: the thematic head clause is off-sequence. In languages like Wambon and Usan the two types of THL select different verb types: medial verbs that express switch reference (same versus different subject) and/or sequence-simultaneity distinctions occur in the chained type and independent verbs that cannot express these distinctions occur in the second, thematic type. THL has four functions, referential coherence, processing ease, thematic continuity (chained type) and thematic discontinuity (thematized type). The phonological form of THL (slowly pronounced, rising intonation, pause phenomena) reflects its processing function to give speakers and addressees a break between two chains.},

Based on a close analysis of a corpus of spontaneous conversational Indonesian data, the author examines four construction types which express what is often encoded by complements in other languages: juxtaposed clauses, material introduced by the discourse marker bahwa, serial verbs, and epistemic expressions with the suffix -nya. These four construction types offer no evidence to support complementation as a viable grammatical category in colloquial spoken Indonesian. Rather, they are best understood as emergent, discourse-level phenomena, arising from the interactive and communicative goals of language users. The lack of evidence for complementation in colloquial Indonesian reaffirms the need to understand linguistic structure as language-particular and diverse, and emphasizes the centrality of studying linguistic categories based on their actual occurrence in natural discourse.},

Assuming these two propositions, then, we should expect grammar itself to be directly implicated in stancetaking. In other words, if stancetaking is a frequent activity of language use, and if frequent activities of language use themselves play a part in shaping language form, then it follows that stancetaking must therefore also be understood as having a role in shaping language form, and the grammatical resources of a language should likewise reflect principles of stancetaking. This paper examines three such resources in colloquial Indonesian, based on a corpus of spontaneous conversational data. I demonstrate how Indonesian speakers use first-person-singular referring expressions, the -nya clitic, and verbal diathesis (voice) respectively to manage and index three facets of stancetaking in everyday conversational interaction: identity, epistemicity, and positioning. I further argue that traditional descriptions and accounts have overlooked crucial aspects of the meaning and function of these three grammatical resources. Adopting a view of grammar as rooted in social interaction (in this case, specifically, the social and interactional processes of stancetaking) provides a rich set of previously undocumented observations about their meaning and use.},

European technologies of literacy enabled missionary and nonmissionary linguistic work that resulted in representations of languages as powerful icons of spiritual, territorial, and historical hierarchies that emerged in colonial societies. As descriptions of languages traveled from exotic colonial peripheries to European metropoles, they came under the purview of comparative philology.

Transmigration has been an important cause of forest loss in Indonesia. World Bank financing promoted the program directly over the 1976--1989 period and continues to underwrite other settlement models that have supplanted earlier programs. The bank projects included creating and strengthening a Ministry of Transmigration, which also carried out settlements of types other than those financed as discrete components of bank loans. Some of these indirectly supported activities have had particularly serious human rights consequences. The case of transmigration provides valuable lessons for tropical countries and international development agencies such as the World Bank, and many of these lessons have yet to be learned.},

 abstract = {Multilingual settings differ from each other in so many ways that every student of multilingualism must grapple with the problem of how best to systematize or organize the manifold differences that are readily recognizable. This chapter is primarily limited to a formal consideration of several descriptive and analytic variables which may contribute to an understanding of who speaks what language to whom and when in those settings that are characterized by widespread and relatively stable multilingualism. It deals primarily with ``withingroup (or intragroup) multilingualism'' rather than with ``between-group (or intergroup) multilingualism,'' that is with those multilingual settings in which a single population makes use of two (or more) separate codes for internal communicative purposes. As a result of this limitation, general knowledge of mother tongue and other tongue may be ruled out as an operative variable since most individuals could communicate with each other quite easily in either of the available languages. It seems clear, however, that habitual language choice is far from being a random matter of momentary inclination, even under those circumstances when it could very well function as such from a purely probabilistic point of view. ``Proper'' usage, or common usage, or both, dictate that only one of the theoretically co-available languages will be chosen by particular classes of interlocutors on particular occasions.

How can these choice-patterns be described? Our basic conceptual problem in this connection is to provide for the variety of patterns that exist in stable withingroup multi-lingual settings throughout the world in such a way as to attain factual accuracy, theoretical parsimony and stimulation of future research. Once we have mastered the problem of how to describe language choice on the level of individual face-to-face encounters, we can then approach the problem of the broader, underlying choice determinants on the level of larger group or cultural settings (Fishman, 1964). Once we have mastered the problem of how to describe language choice in stable within-group bilingual settings (where the limits of language mastery do not intrude), we can then approach the problem of choice determinants in less stable settings such as those characterizing immigranthost relationships and between-group multilingual settings more generally.},

@article{Gal.1995,
 abstract = {In nineteenth-century Europe, the rise of interest in exotic languages as well as local dialects coincided with colonial expansion and the creation of a European regime of nation-states. Through the dichotomizing discourses of orientalism, Europe created itself in opposition to a broadly defined {\dq}East{\dq} that often included not only Asia but also Africa. As Said (1978), Olender (1992), Mudimbe (1988), and others have pointed out, scholars of language and ideas about linguistic differences played a significant part in the development of such categories of identity. Arguments about language were central in producing and buttressing European claims to difference from the rest of the world, and claims to the superiority of the metropolitan bourgeoisie over {\dq}backward{\dq} or {\dq}primitive{\dq} others, whether they were residents of other continents, other provinces, or other social classes. Language could be central to these arguments because by the mid-nineteenth century language came to be seen as crucially unaffected by human will, individual intent, or the particularities of social life (Formigari, 1985; Taylor, 1990). Although Saussure's argument for a {\dq}science of language{\dq} that would be divorced from the everyday speech of its speakers is today the most familiar of these formulations, earlier approaches that differed sharply in other ways nevertheless shared this view of language's independence. To them, languages were natural objects, consequences of spiritual or even biological differences between populations.},

 abstract = {Conjunctions are forms with meanings similar to that of English and. Universal quantifiers are expressions with meanings resembling those of English every, each, and all.

Logicians, as well as logically-minded linguists, have suggested that there is a close affinity between conjunctions and universal quantifiers. For example, in the context of a class consisting of five students, Alice, Bill, John, Mary and Susan, sentence (1) with the conjoined NP Alice, Bill, John, Mary and Susan  is logically equivalent to sentence (2) with the universally quantified noun phrase every student.

(1) Alice, Bill, John, Mary and Susan passed the exam.

(2) Every student passed the exam.

Based on observations such as these, some semanticists have proposed deriving the interpretations of universal quantifiers from those of conjunctions. For example, in the Boolean Semantics of Keenan and Faltz (1986), conjunctions and universal quantifiers are both represented in terms of set-theoretic intersections. 

How well do such semantic representations correspond to the observable lexical and grammatical patterns of languages? On the basis of examples such as (1) and (2) above, one might suspect that they do not correspond at all well. Thus, in English, the conjunction and  and the universal quantifier every  are distinct words with quite different grammatical properties.

However, a broader cross-linguistic perspective suggests that there are indeed widespread lexical and grammatical resemblances between conjunctions and universal quantifiers, thereby lending support to the logicians' analyses. The purpose of this map is to portray some of these connections, and, in doing so, to show how the cross-linguistic study of such lexical and grammatical patterns can be of relevance to logicians and their theories of formal semantics.},

@incollection{Gil.2013,
 abstract = {Has anybody ever written an article arguing that English does not have a grammatical category of dual number, as in, say Slovenian, Arabic, or Yimas? Almost certainly nobody has or ever will, because to do so would be pointless, not to mention with little chance of ever getting published. After all, it is self-evident that there is no dual in English, and there is no reason to believe that, contrary to appearances, all languages should, for some reason or other, have a dual. Moreover, once its non-existence is duly acknowledged, there just isn't much else to say about the English dual.

By the same token, linguists do not write articles arguing that English does not distinguish between alienable and inalienable possession, as does Dholuo; does not mark clausal switch reference, like in Diegue{\~n}o; or does not have a system of multiple speech levels, as in Javanese. Similarly, for other languages, linguists do not go to great efforts trying to prove that Russian does not have definite or indefinite articles; that Turkish does not have grammatical gender; and that Sentani does not have a passive construction.

There is an obvious reason: these linguistic features, like so many others, represent properties with respect to which we take for granted that languages may vary; hence, we expect to find languages in which these features are absent. But there is another, somewhat deeper reason: all of the above examples involve a privative contrast between the presence of a feature and its absence, and in such cases, Occam's razor suggests that, as a default hypothesis, we adopt the simpler assumption that the feature is absent, until we come across positive evidence leading towards the more complex conclusion that it is present. Accordingly, while good reference grammars take note of such absences, there is no perceived need to dwell on them, or to construct explicit arguments in their justification.

However, when it comes to parts of speech, or syntactic categories, the rules of the game are somewhat different. Within many linguistic traditions, it is still assumed that all languages have the same parts-of-speech system, be it the eight parts of speech of traditional Latin grammar, or the syntactic categories posited within your favourite version of generative grammar. More recently, however, a substantial body of work, much within the framework of linguistic typology, has moved away from this assumption, and begun to explore possible patterns of cross-linguistic variation with respect to parts-of-speech systems and inventories of syntactic categories; see for example Hengeveld (1992), Vogel and Comrie eds., (2000), Croft (2001), Beck (2002), Dixon and Aikhenvald eds. (2006), and of course the present volume.

Nevertheless, even within this more recent work, there would still seem to be a lingering assumption that the default parts-of-speech system is one that is more or less similar to the familiar system of traditional Latin or generative grammar, and that any significant deviations from such systems, in particular in the direction of systems with fewer distinctions, are the ones that are somehow extraordinary and therefore worthy of special mention. One need go no further than the present volume and the term flexibility, featuring prominently in its title and in many of its chapters. As a reaction to the assumption that all languages are like Latin, the concern with such so-called flexible parts-of-speech systems is welcome and long-overdue. Still, the term flexibility, and much of the associated discussion, embodies an upside-down way of looking at variation in parts-of-speech systems. To be flexible means to be {\dq}able to bend or be bent repeatedly{\dq} (according to a typical dictionary definition); flexibility thus presupposes an original or canonical form, shape or configuration from which the flexible object may, under appropriate conditions, depart. However, such a presupposition is at odds with Occam's razor, which points towards the opposite default hypothesis, namely that syntactic categories should be assumed to be absent until positive evidence is found to the effect that such distinctions are in fact present. In practical terms, what this means is that, when describing a new language, we should not ask questions such as {\dq}How do I distinguish between, say, nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions?{\dq}, but rather questions along the lines of {\dq}What are the interesting patterns of features and how can I account for them?{\dq} --- and if the best account involves positing syntactic categories such as, say, nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions, so be it. In theoretical terms, this suggests that preference should be given to theories in which the default inventory of syntactic categories is the minimal one, and more complex inventories characterized as more highly marked, such as, for example, Gil (2000c).

The same holds true in the particular case of concern to use here: the distinction between noun and verbs. It is commonly assumed that this is the most robust parts-ofspeech distinction in language, and that if a language will make any parts-of-speech distinction at all, it will be between nouns and verbs; see for example Evans (2000:103), Croft (2003:183). Nevertheless, a number of recent and not-so-recent works have been devoted to arguing that various languages lack a noun/verb distinction; for example Shkarban (1992, 1995) and Gil (1993b,c, 1995) for Tagalog, Tchekhoff (1984) and Broschart (1997) for Tongan, Jelinek and Demers (1994) for Straits Salish, Swadesh (1939) for Nootka, and others. In order to dispel the notion that the noun/verb distinction is universal, such works are obviously necessary and welcome. But of course, such works are just like that hypothetical paper arguing that English has no dual. Ideally, such papers would not have to be written. Rather, linguists would describe their respective languages in the most parsimonious way, and then other linguists would examine these descriptions and make cross-linguistic generalizations about the parts-of-speech systems and syntactic category inventories that they require. But things don't work like that, and the claim that there are languages that do not distinguish between nouns and verbs remains controversial. Hence, even though it is like arguing that English has no dual, it is still necessary to go to the effort of defending the claim that some languages really do not distinguish between nouns and verbs. This, then, is the goal of the present paper, namely, to argue that in at least one language, the Riau dialect of Indonesian, there is no distinction between nouns and verbs.},

I am writing this from a beautiful little town called Manokwari, in a part of the world that is of great interest to linguists, being located on the island of New Guinea where some 15{\%} of the world's languages are spoken.  However, within New Guinea, Manokwari finds itself situated in a region which, although clear and well-defined, has no straightforward way to refer to it.  Or, in other words, a place without a name.

Some years back, Matthew Dryer asked for my opinion on how one should refer to the western half of New Guinea, the part of the island under Indonesian control, formerly constituting the province of Irian Jaya.  At the time I had no answer to his question, a fact which bothered me somewhat.  However, in the meantime, an answer has presented itself, in the form of a term that has recently gained currency as a designation for the region in question.  The term is Tanah Papua.  Tanah is the Malay and Indonesian word for `land', so Tanah Papua means `Land of Papua'.  My aim here is to answer Matthew Dryer's question by proposing that we, as linguists, adopt the term Tanah Papua when speaking and writing about the region in question, in English or any other language.},

 abstract = {This new edition of Syntax: A functional-typological introduction  is at many points radically revised. In the previous edition (1984) the author deliberately chose to de-emphasize the more formal aspects of syntactic structure, in favor of a more comprehensive treatment of the semantic and pragmatic correlates of syntactic structure. With hindsight the author now finds the de-emphasis of the formal properties a somewhat regrettable choice, since it creates the false impression that one could somehow be a functionalist without being at the same time a structuralist. To redress the balance, explicit treatment is given to the core formal properties of syntactic constructions, such as constituency and hierarchy (phrase structure), grammatical relations and relational control, clause union, finiteness and governed constructions.

At the same time, the cognitive and communicative underpinning of grammatical universals are further elucidated and underscored, and the interplay between grammar, cognition and neurology is outlined. Also the relevant typological database is expanded, now exploring in greater precision the bounds of syntactic diversity. Lastly, Syntax treats synchronic-typological diversity more explicitly as the dynamic by-product of diachronic development or grammaticalization. In so doing a parallel is drawn between linguistic diversity and diachrony on the one hand and biological diversity and evolution on the other. It is then suggested that --- as in biology --- synchronic universals of grammar are exercised and instantiated primarily as constraints on development, and are thus merely the apparent by-products of universal constraints on grammaticalization.},

 abstract = {There are at least four senses in which one can talk about clause or sentence types in a language. One way is in terms of the distinction between declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences. This distinction, really one of sentence type, is discussed elsewhere in this volume by K{\"o}nig and Siemund in chapter 5. A second sense of clause type is represented by the distinction between main clause and subordinate clause, and among different types of subordinate clauses. Issues related to this sense are discussed in the chapters on subordination, such as vol. ii, chapter 2 by Noonan, and vol. ii, chapter 4 by Andrews. A third sense of clause type concerns the way the same event or situation can be spoken about, from different perspectives, with grammatical consequences such as voice and pragmatic consequences such as topic and focus. This kind of variation is discussed in chapter 7 by Foley. The fourth sense, the one discussed in this chapter, involves different types of clauses in terms of their internal structure, primarily surrounding different types of predicates. Here, the most basic distinction is between verbal and nonverbal predicates. In much of this chapter, differences in clause type hinge on the part of speech of words serving in predicates, to which chapter 1 by Schachter and Shopen is relevant. Among clauses with verbal predicates, we can make further distinctions based on the argument structure of the verb, including the distinction between transitive and intransitive clauses and finer distinctions. These are discussed in section 2 below. We first examine, in section 1, different types of clauses with nonverbal predicates.},

 abstract = {Morphological marking, whether realized by nominal case inflections or cross-referencing on the verb, can be either (i) ergative, marking transitive subject [A] function, vs. absolutive, marking intransitive subject [S] and transitive object [O]; or (ii) nominative, marking A and S, vs. accusative, marking O function. Absolutive is always the unmarked term in an absolutive/ergative opposition. Nominative is most frequently the unmarked term in a nominative/accusative system, but there are some languages in which accusative is unmarked. A language whose morphology mixes accusative and ergative marking has the split determined by (a) the semantic content of verbs, (b) the semantic content of NP's, (c) aspect/tense choice, or (d) a combination of these. A, S, and O are universal semantic-syntactic primitives. A universal category of 'subject' can be defined as the set {A,S}, and is valid only for the level of deep structure. Language-particular syntactic operations, such as coordination and subordination, work in terms of a (shallow-structure) 'pivot'; this is most often S/A, but can be wholly or partly S/O (languages of the latter type are said to be ergative at the syntactic level). A major function of antipassive or passive derivations is to place A or O NP's (respectively) in derived pivot function, S. Many languages which have some morphological ergativity are entirely accusative (S/A pivot) at the syntactic level. All languages that show syntactic ergativity have some morphological ergativity.},

 abstract = {This chapter is concerned with adjectives in the narrow sense---that is, descriptive adjectives such as 'red', 'heavy', and 'loyal'---leaving aside other types of noun modifier, demonstratives, and interrogatives. I suggest that a distinct word class 'adjectives' can be recognized for every human language. In some languages, adjectives have similar grammatical properties to nouns, in some to verbs, in some to both nouns and verbs, and in some to neither. I suggest that there are always some grammatical criteria---sometimes rather subtle---for distinguishing the adjective class from other word classes.

In the present chapter, {\S}1 discusses the three major word classes and their typical semantic content; {\S}2 outlines basic clause types and core arguments, with a warning of the importance of using the term 'predicate' with a narrow meaning. After a mention of criteria for distinguishing between noun and verb, in {\S}3, there is a profile of the adjective class, in {\S}4, and then, in {\S}5, comment on Eurocentric attitudes towards the label 'adjective'. Subsequently, {\S}6 deals with the four types of adjective---similar to verbs in their grammatical properties (with criteria for distinguishing between the classes), similar to nouns (again, with relevant distinguishing criteria), similar to both verbs and nouns, and different from both classes. In {\S}7 there is a brief discussion of languages whose adjectives have restricted functional possibilities, and in {\S}8 of languages with two adjective classes. A correlation between types of adjective class and head/dependent marking is explored in {\S}9. Semantic overlap between the three major word classes, and how the overlaps differ between languages, are discussed in {\S}10. The following chapters in the volume are introduced in {\S}11. Finally, a set of conclusions is given in {\S}12.},

It is convenient for the purposes of discussion to distinguish three sorts of noun phrases: (i) simple noun phrases, which contain only pronouns or nouns plus simple modifiers like articles, adjectives, demonstratives, or numerals; (ii) complex noun phrases, which contain more complex sorts of modifiers, like genitive or possessive modifiers and relative clauses; and (iii) various sorts of noun phrases which lack a head noun.

The investigations focus on ways of combining clauses other than through relative and complement clause constructions. These span a number of types of semantic linking. Three, for example, describe varieties of consequence - cause, result, and purpose - which may be illustrated in English by, respectively: Because John has been studying German for years, he speaks it well; John has been studying German for years, thus he speaks it well; and John has been studying German for years, in order that he should speak it well. Syntactic descriptions of languages provide a grammatical analysis of clause types. The chapters in this book add the further dimension of semantics, generally in the form of focal and supporting clauses, the former referring to the central activity or state of the biclausal linking; and the latter to the clause attached to it. The supporting clause may set out the temporal milieu for the focal clause or specify a condition or presupposition for it or a preliminary statement of it, as in Although John has been studying German for years (the supporting clause), he does not speak it well (the focal clause). Professor Dixon's extensive opening discussion is followed by fourteen case studies of languages ranging from Korean and Kham to Iquito and Ojibwe.

@book{Bauer.1983,
 abstract = {The study of word-formation seems to be emerging from a fallow period. Suddenly word-formation is of central interest to theoretical linguists of all persuasions because of the light it throws on other aspects of language. Unfortunately, there is little agreement on the methodology or basic theoretical background for the study of word-formation, so that the field is currently a confused one.

There is, at the moment, no single {\dq}theory of word-formation{\dq}, nor even agreement on the kind of data that is relevant for the construction of such a theory. This book will not provide a theory, but it will provide an introduction to, and discussion of, some of the basic problems confronting students of word-formation, and draw some conclusions which, it seems to me, must be basic to any future theory. However, given the confusion that reigns at the moment, it should be borne in mind that virtually any theoretical statement about word-formation is controversial, and that this book provides a starting point for discussion more than a body of accepted theoretical dogma.

The basic approach to word-formation taken in this book is synchronic and transformational; but the synchrony is diluted by frequent consideration of diachronic facts, and the way in which the transformational background has been used is untraditional. In particular, ideas and data have been drawn from a wide range of sources, including 'taxonomic' studies as well as transformational ones, and, although the approach envisaged is basically syntactic, other aspects have not been ignored, and phonology, morphology, semantics and pragmatics are all considered.

It is hoped that this book will prove stimulating to scholars with a special interest in word-formation, but that it will also be of value to undergraduates. With this in mind, the book has been presented so that it can be read by someone who has no previous experience of word·formation, or of morphology at all, but a certain amount of background in linguistics has been presupposed. In particular, since word·formation is nowadays rarely studied by students of linguistics before they are familiar with the basics of syntactic theory, a knowledge of transformational grammar as presented in Chomsky (1965) is assumed, not only the general framework of the grammar proposed there, but also notions such as competence and performance and the methodological importance in transformational studies of capturing generalizations. A consequence of this is that much of chapter 2 will be too basic for readers with a broader background in linguistics, and they are invited to skip those sections which are not relevant for them. Chapters 3 and 4 introduce the two main theoretical claims that are made in this book. Chapters 5 and 6 are considerably more technical and specialized. In chapter 7 the range of word-formation processes available in English is considered, and then, in chapter 8 a body of data is considered in the light of the theoretical points that have been made earlier in the book, and the close examination of this body of data leads to further general points of theoretical interest.},

 abstract = {This article discusses the language shift from mother tongues towards Fulfulde in Girei, Song, and Gombi Local Government Areas of Adamawa State, Nigeria. This study discovers that, even though a language of interethnic communication among the various ethnic groups and the Fulani in the study area already exists (namely, Hausa), there has been a shift towards Fulfulde. It is shown that the language shift affects the function not only of the shifting language, but also of the target language, as Fulfulde has intruded into more domains of life and functions among the different ethnic groups in the study area. The article shows further that other languages are less used and are finally threatened as the languages of the home. While economic, social, political, religious, and contextual factors are identified as some of the causes for the shift, language spread, language endangerment or language decline, additive bilingualism, and code-switching are found to be some of the sociolinguistic implications of the shift.},

Es ist laut heutiger Forschung vor allem an der Nordkuste verbreitet. Trotzdem wird dem Papua Malay bis heute nur wenig Beachtung geschenkt. Dementsprechend uneindeutig ist dessen Status. Sprachwissenschaftler forderten erst 2007 einen eigenen Code fur diese Sprache3, wahrend er in grosen Teilen der Bevolkerung immer noch als {\dq}ragam non-baku{\dq} (Nicht-Standard- Varietat) des Indonesischen oder sogar als {\dq}falsches Indonesisch {\dq}betrachtet wird. Linguistisch kann nicht zwischen Sprache und Dialekt unterschieden werden (Mesthrie, 2009: 8). Alle Sprachen sind von ihrem linguistischen Potenzial gleich, aber nicht in ihrer gesellschaftlichen Position (ibd: 33). Deswegen ist das Ziel dieser Arbeit, diese Sprache unter verschiedenen Aspekten der Gesellschaft zu beleuchten, um daraus ihre Position und Bedeutung abzulesen. Neben einer Einordnung in den linguistischen Forschungsstand werden die Sichtweisen der wichtigsten Akteure vorgestellt: die Sprachpolitik als Reprasentant der indonesischen Regierung, die Unabhangigkeitsbewegung als Stimme des Volkes und schlieslich die Mission. Weiterhin wird die Verwendung der Sprache in der Kirche und in der Bildung aufgezeigt.

Diese Sichtweisen lassen Schwierigkeiten beziehungsweise gesellschaftliche Probleme deutlich werden, aus denen sich viele Fragen entwickeln lassen. Diese Fragen konnen als Ansatzpunkt fur Uberlegungen der Akteure selbst sowie fur weitere Forschungsarbeit dienen.},

Beginning with a general description of the social consequences of several languages being used in one society, Ralph Fasold moves on to discuss 'diglossia', the phenomena by which social functions are assigned to languages and dialects in a predictable manner. Other aspects of the subject covered here include social attitudes towards various languages and dialects, the social forces which influence multilingual people to use different language sin different situations, and wholesale shifts by social groups from one language to another (and the converse, retention of particular languages. The theory and practice of language planning, and the significance of language in education, are examined and explained. In addition, the book deals with qualitative and quantitative methods of analysing multilingualism and includes a helpful chapter on statistical techniques.

Written by a leading sociolinguist and teacher, this textbook is a comprehensive and authoritative guide to the field. With the beginner in mind, the author writes in a clear, relaxed style, explaining current theories and giving many examples from all parts of the world.

One of these is East Formosan, a previously unrecognized group which includes Basay·Trobiawan, Kavalan, Amis and Siraya. By contrast, Paiwan and Puyuma have been in an intensive borrowing relationship for centuries, and although they share many innovations exclusively of other languages, their relationship to one another remams unclear. It is likely that the Austronesian homeland included portions of southern China, and that language extinctions have played a major role in skewing the distribution of surviving witnesses. Although the Austronesian migrations into insular Southeast Asia and the Pacific generally were quite rapid, there is evidence for two long pauses, the first in Taiwan, and the second in the Fiji·Tonga·Samoa triangle. It is argued that both pauses were caused by technological limitations in voyaging capability which had to be overcome before further movement was possible.},

 abstract = {Even though, in this paper, I simply follow Payne's notes on discourse (1997, p342-361), it is good to be reminded of Schiffrin's observation on the subject. 

To have a broad idea of what 'discourse' is all about, I suggest chapter one of Schiffrin's discussion on 'discourse markers' (1987). For her, because 'discourse discussion is a vast and ambiguous field', the best way to understand what 'discourse' is all about is to understand what language is all about. There are four key assumptions about language that, according to Schiffrin (1987, p3-6), play significant role in discourse analysis, as quoted below: 

1 Language always occurs in a context ' ... language always occurs in some kind of context, including cognitive contexts in which past experience and knowledge is stored and drewn upon, cultural contexts consisting of shared meanings and world views, and social contexts through which both self and others draw upon institutional and interactional orders to construct definitions of situation and actions.' (page 4) 

2 Language is context sensitive ,... language is potentially sensitive to all of the contexts in which it occurs, and, even more strongly, that language reflects those contexts because it helps to constitute them.' (page 5) 

3 Language is always communicative ' ... language is always communicative either because it is directed toward a recipient (immediate or eventual) because it is intended to be so directed, and/or because it is attended by the recipient.' (page 6) 

4 Language is designed for communication ' ... language is designed for communication, or as Lyons (l977a: 638) states, that 'there is much in the structure of languages that can only be explained on the assumption that they have developed for communication in face-to-face interaction.' (page 6) 

These four points of Schiffrin's are the starting points of Payne (1997, p342):},

@inproceedings{Burung.2007,
 abstract = {Melayu Papua is a term used here to designate a variety of Melayu spoken by people in the wetsren part of New Guinea Island, occupied by Indonesia. It is a Melayu variety, which has a less attention than other nonstandard varieties throughout Indonesia. As most Melayu varieties, Melayu Papua typologically takes subject-verb-object word order with, more or less, isolating construction in its structure as in sa mo makan nasi ` I want to eat some rice'; where as Melayu Papua also applies model of simple declarative clauses as in de makan nasi `he/she eats some rice' or dong pukul sa `they hit me'.

One common phenomenon in the Melayu Papua grammar is to construct causatives. The causative constructions generally represent a linguistic expression which denotes a complex macro-situation consisting of two micro-situations or component events (Song 2001). Such an idea indicates two compoents which are 1) the causing event in which the causer does or initiates something in order to bring about a different event (i,e. the caused event), and 2) the caused event in which the causee carries out an action or undergoes a change of condition or state as a result of the causer's action. To strategize causatives in Melayu Papua, two verbs play their roles structurally and semantically as the causing event: kasi `to give' and bikin `to make'. Semantically, the word kasi `to give' is a bitransitive verb with a benefactive action as in sa kasi ko buku ` I give you (a/some) book(s); while the word bikin `to make' is also a transitive/bitransitive verb, which needs a direct object/two objects such as in tong bikin kue `we make a cake' or dong bikin kue untuk kam `they make you a cake'.

Configuring causative constructions, serial verbs constructions with the causing verb kasi `to give' and bikin `to make' function to describe a causer's action and the causee's action by the predicate of effect (Song, 2001) are used. These two verbs -- the causer's action and the causee's action happen to be separate lexical verbs.

1.  sa kasi ko jatu

     I give(CAUS) you fall

    'I cause you to fall'

2.  sa kasi jatu ko

     I give(CAUS) fall you

     `I cause you to fall'

3.  kam bikin sa me-nangis

     2p make(CAUS) 1s ACT-cry

     `you(pl) make me cry'

Syntactically, the causative verb kasi `to give' takes two possible structures as in 1 and 2; while the causative verb bikin `to make' takes only one structure as in 3.

To sum up our talk, causative constructions in Melayu Papua is basically a syntactical strategy in which serial verb constructions are used when two verbs kasi `to give' and bikin `to make' act as the causer's action and the second verb indicates the causee's action. Both causative verbs have the same semantic/pragmatic use but they have a variation in syntactic structures.

 abstract = {The voice system of Malay and Indonesian varieties shows complications, with typologically unusual systems found within a single variety and a great range of variation found across

different varieties. Among the variables that we find are:

• the number and nature of voice contrasts;

• the status of the agent in a non-active clause;

• the role of the person (first, second, or third) of an agent on eligibility for different voices;

• the coding of oblique agents, and any polysemy between this morphological expression and other uses of the same morphology;

• the morphology employed in the different voice choices (and any markedness relationship between them);

• the zero-encoding of a particular voice type or types;

• the relationship between the morphology used to code non-active clauses and its use in active clauses;

• the non-voice/non-transitivity uses of voice morphology in different varieties.

In this paper I examine some typologically interesting variation in voice in a small number of eastern Malay varieties, comparing the results to trends found more widely in the Malayspeaking world, and propose that an account can be made of the variation with a set of formal constraints on the encoding of pragmatic information that have different levels of importance in different varieties.},

Papuan Malay has innovative forms and functions for its pronominals that have not been described in detail for other varieties of Malay/Indonesian, though they are present over a wide area. We examine both the bound and the free pronominal forms, describing the status of the different members in each paradigm as they are used with different functions such as possessor, subject and object. In addition to noting these different uses we discuss a trivalent construction in the language with an exceptional use of pronominal forms, and proposed an ongoing path of grammaticalisation that can account for it.},

I offer a number of other correlations between word order features and geographic area, establishing that the well-discussed division between eastern and western (or Papuan and Austronesian) languages in the Indonesian archipelago is not a crisp one, but is one that should be essentially maintained. Despite the fact that the division, traditionally based on the position of the genitive, generally matches the western boundary of Central Malayo-Polynesian (Blust 1993), a better explanation for the break is shown to be influence from languages with a typology matching that found in western New Guinea. At the same time, the much less discussed break between the northern and the southern Austronesian languages is established, mapping the contrast between the northern, Philippinetype Austronesian languages and their southern neighbours, despite the lack of any well-accepted genetic boundary between these two areas, implying substratal influence similar to that which characterises the eastern Austronesian languages.},

 abstract = {Much has been written about linguistic divergence, in the sense of the gradual historical fissioning of one language into what must eventually be considered distinct linguistic codes (see, for instance, Antilla 1989, Crowley 1987, Lass 1997). More recently a respectable amount of work has been produced about the `opposite' end of the scale of language development, about linguistic convergence, in which languages, often of diverse typological profiles and/or diverse genetic backgrounds, show degrees of mutual assimilation in a defined social or geographic zone (see, for instance, the papers in Bakker and Mous 1994, and also Heath 1978, 1981, Mithun (this volume), Thomason and Kaufman 1988, Thurston 1987, Ross 1999, Weinreich 1963, amongst others).

In Indonesian/Malay we have an instance of a historically-attested single language which has spread, through trade and later bilingualism, over a wide area of insular Southeast Asia in the course of what is for language spread a very short time. The speed and geographic scope of this diffusion represents a spread of a magnitude that is rivaled only in the period of European colonisation. The legacy of that spread is a remarkably rich range of varieties of Indonesian/Malay across the archipelago, varieties which hover on the border of mutual intelligibility. While the overall lexical simi larity between different Malay varieties is high, differences centre of the high-frequency functors (aspect markers, negation, and especially pronouns, this last most markedly in the vicinity of New Guinea). This combines with various grammatical differences to lead to the almost or functional unintelligibility that is found when speakers of one variety of Indonesian/ Malay encounter speakers from other areas and who do not command the standard languages.

This paper takes voice systems as a diagnostic of variation, and examines the variation in the scope of six different Indonesian/Malay voice systems seen as the (re-)rankings of various universal constraints. Following the description and analysis of these different patterns, I shall explain as far as possible the changes in terms of deviation from a more conservative model, a historically prior system which is still attested in the Philippines, guided by functional, language variety-internal considerations and possible local language interference or influence. The description of variance will be phrased in terms of correlations with the high-ranking constraints in each system, and their relative rise and fall. This offers a model that accounts for the development of the different voice systems while illustrating both the conservatism that Austronesian languages are known for, as well as a tendency to develop from a typologically unusual, and evidently `unstable' system to a variety of more widely attested, and so presumably typologically stable, voice systems.},

A number of phonological or semantic changes are claimed as forming the basis of this distinction, as well as the typological profile of the languages to the east being different from those to the west, and a number of lexical items being attested only east of the line. We examine the phonological and semantic innovations, as well as the erratic morphological ones, showing that none of them define the CEMP line, but indicate that (a) the Central Malayo-Polynesian (CMP)--area languages do not convincingly meet the criteria commonly accepted for a subgroup or even a linkage, (b) some of the WMP-area languages exhibit more of the same features found in at least some of the CMP-area languages than do others, and (c) many of the traits ascribed to the CMP- or CEMP-area languages can be found in more conservative WMP-area or Formosan languages as well.},

 abstract = {This article examines the divergent voice systems of a selection of Malay/Indonesian varieties. I will show that the voice systems of the different Malay/Indonesian varieties largely (but not completely) reflect the voice systems in the languages in which that variety is spoken. In this way Malay/Indonesian, in its different varieties, can be seen as a mirror on the development of voice systems in Austronesian languages. While many languages show a syntactically privileged `subject', in many western Austronesian languages (including Malay/Indonesian) some subject properties accrue according to argument structure position, and some other of these properties accrue to the argument that is morphologically marked as `special' in the clause. At the same time, those Austronesian languages belonging to the (eastern) Oceanic branch lack voice alternations, or else show a simple active/passive dichotomy. The change in the presence and nature voice systems follows the migration path of the Austronesians, moving the highly marked diathesis to a more `normal' diathesis. The voice systems of the different Malay varieties vary greatly, encompassing almost all the variation that is found across the Austronesian languages. I propose a model in terms of the speakers' access to universal grammar in determining the grammar of the new variety of Malay/Indonesian.},

 abstract = {As with all parts of the Indonesian archipelago in which there was extensive pre-independence contact with the Dutch, who used a variety of Malay as an administrative language, or which had even earlier contact with Malay-speaking traders, a local, rather than `standard', variety of Malay is used over many of the coastal areas in the eastern province of Papua (formerly Irian Jaya; the name changed in late 2001). This variety is not, as is widely assumed by non-native speakers in the province, a simplified, `reduced', `pidgin', or `dumbed-down' version of standard Indonesian, but rather represents the endpoint of a linguistic tradition of its own. It is certainly true that there are strong elements of non-standard grammar in the language, and that many if not most of the morphological devices of Standard Indonesian are absent in Papuan Malay. There is, however, a compensating proliferation of alternative morphological and syntactic constructions that are not found in Standard Indonesian, which serve to render Papuan Malay at least as complex as Standard Indonesian, though with a substantially different set of areal influences shaping its structure (see Gil 1994, 2002 for a similar account of the differences between standard Malay and Riau Indonesian).},

@book{Dooley.2001,
 abstract = {This manual has been written as an introduction to discourse analysis for future linguistic field workers. We believe that the most effective way for most people to learn how discourse works in a particular language is by interacting with discourse principles while analyzing texts from that language. We therefore present the essential minimum, the most basic concepts of discourse, as a foundation for subsequent in-depth analysis with field data. We also believe that basic discourse notions are invaluable in all aspects of a language program. Those aspects range from language learning to lexical, semantic, and morphosyntactic analysis, right

on through to linguistic applications such as education and literature production, where clear communication is of fundamental importance.

Our goals for this manual imply a combination of features that we have not found elsewhere. First, we intend it to be practical, addressing issues commonly confronted by field linguists. Rather than attempting to apply a rigid theory or survey a variety of approaches, we provide a methodology that has been refined over years of use. Second, although we follow no rigid theory, we aim for more than a ``grab bag'' of diverse methodologies by attempting to present the material within a coherent and productive framework. Specifically, we follow a functional and cognitive approach that seems to be a good approximation of how discourse is actually produced and understood. Third, we have kept the manual brief. Most chapters are no longer than six pages, and the whole can be covered in fifteen classroom hours. Although our aim is introductory rather than comprehensive, we do provide references for further reading on the topics discussed.

The manual can be used individually or in group sessions, such as in a formal course or a working seminar (linguistic workshop). In a group setting, concepts can be illustrated by examining further texts, from a single

language, language area, family or type, or from a typological variety of languages.

Our grateful thanks go to all those who have given us feedback on the contents of this manual, pointing out errors and suggesting how the chapters could be improved. We would like particularly to mention Paul

Vollrath, who worked through every chapter in depth and put a lot of thought into how the material could more clearly be presented.},

 abstract = {`East Nusantara', the name used in the title of this book, refers to the islands of eastern Indonesia and East Timor. `Nusantara' is a term that has come to refer to the Indo-Malaysian archipelago generally, without reference to national borders. For the purpose of this volume, we define East Nusantara as a geographical area that extends from Sumbawa in the west, across the islands of East Nusa Tenggara and Maluku, including Halmahera, to the Bird's Head of New Guinea in the east. In the northwest, the area is bounded by Sulawesi. Some 400 languages are spoken in East Nusantara, most of which are endangered in terms of numbers of speakers, and the majority of which have not yet been described. Linguistically this geographic region displays great genetic diversity, being the meeting ground of languages belonging to the Austronesian and Papuan language families. Yet, similarities cut across language family boundaries, giving rise to the notion of a linguistic area or Sprachbund. In chapter one, we present a brief history of the region and an overview of recent research that has had East Nusantara in its scope. This serves as a general background for the chapters on individual languages that make up the rest of the volume. The strong focus on presenting new data from a range of previously underdocumented languages in the region also provides valuable input for further comparative work. Taken together these chapters demonstrate the significance of East Nusantara as a region of linguistic enquiry. At the same time, they highlight the ability of ongoing investigations, both empirical and theoretical, to help us continue refining the notion of East Nusantara as a linguistic area.},

In addition, the processes of linguistic diffusion are present in New Guinea to an extent probably paralleled elsewhere on the globe.

 abstract = {The New Guinea region is the most linguistically diverse region in the world, with some 1000 languages in an area smaller than 900,000 km2. There are about three dozen language families and close to the same number of language isolates, although two very different language families, each with about 300 languages, dominate: the coastal Austronesian languages, and the montane Trans New Guinea family. The other, smaller families are largely restricted to the northern lowlands.  Typologically, the languages exhibit enormous variation and many unusual properties. Vowel systems in which central vowels predominate and consonantal systems lacking fricatives and, rarer still, nasals are attested. Morphological types range from isolating to polysynthetic, and most languages are head marking. Verbs normally carry more complex inflection than do nouns. Of nominal categories, gender is often exuberantly elaborated, but surprisingly case is not, the weak development being an areal feature, in contrast to Australian languages on the one hand and those of Eurasia on the other. Syntactically, languages fall into left-headed and right-headed types, represented by Austronesian and Trans New Guinea, respectively. Clause chaining and associated morphological structures such as switch reference are a salient feature of right-headed and particularly Trans NewGuinea languages. Discourse structures are often highly elliptical, with the verbal morphology providing signals for the recovery of elided information and the cohesion of the text. Highly ritualized texts, such as songs, are characterized by strict formal rules of parallelism and trope usage. Other than Austronesian, no language family has congeners outside the region, and within it, large-scale processes of convergence have shaped languages over many millennia, giving rise to areal traits.},

 abstract = {The Malay/Indonesian dialectal landscape contains large tracts of terra incognita: undescribed language varieties, indeed even language varieties whose very existence has remained unnoticed. This paper represents a preliminary and necessarily tentative attempt to impose some kind of order upon this bewildering diversity {\~a} in the form of a general classificatory scheme, or typology, of Malay/Indonesian dialects.

The primary parameter in the typology is the lectal cline, with the standardized versions of Malay and Indonesian near the acrolectal pole, and all other dialects further down the scale towards the basilectal pole. Among the basilectal dialects, the next bifurcation is between varieties with a diminished range of functions and no native speakers, including Bazaar Malay, and varieties associated with a wide range of functions and populations of native speakers {\~a} comprising most other Malay/Indonesian dialects. These dialects, in turn, may be classified in accordance with two independent dimensions pertaining to the ethnicity of their speakers:

i.	homogeneous vs. heterogeneous; and

ii.	Malay vs. non-Malay.

The two end points of these two independent scalar dimensions form a 2x2 matrix yielding four idealized dialect types:

I.	Ethnically homogeneous / Malay dialects: generally spoken locally, by indigenous populations, eg. Nonthaburi Malay, Siak Malay.

II.	Ethnically homogeneous / non-Malay dialects: typically spoken by populations who have switched relatively recently to Malay/Indonesian, eg. Baba Malay, Orang Asli Malay.

III.	Ethnically heterogeneous / Malay dialects: characteristically spoken in urban centres or other regions which have been targets of recent migrations, eg. Singaporean Malay, Kuala Lumpur Malay.

IV.	Ethnically heterogeneous / non-Malay dialects: instantiated by some of the modern Indonesian koin{\'e}s, specifically those spoken in regions to which few or no Malays have migrated, eg. Sulsel (Sulawesi Selatan) Indonesian, Irian Indonesian.

In addition, between types (III) and (IV) is an important intermediate group of ethnically heterogeneous / Malay-plus-non-Malay dialects, exemplified by various other Indonesian koin{\'e}s, eg. Riau Indonesian, Kaltim (Kalimantan Timur) Indonesian.

The second part of this paper focuses on the latter types of dialects, namely the Indonesian koin{\'e}s. For the most part, the existence of such koin{\'e}s has remained unacknowledged in the scholarly literature; accordingly, little or nothing is known of their linguistic structure. Thus, for example, a linguistic atlas of Riau province will characterize it as being populated by ethnic Malays, speaking one or more varieties of Sumatran Malay. However, in reality, a majority of the population of this province consists of non-Malay migrants from other provinces: primarily Minangkabau, but also Batak, Javanese, Bugis and others. Accordingly, the common language of the province, and a native language of its younger inhabitants, is an Indonesian koin{\'e}, namely Riau Indonesian. The distinctiveness of Riau Indonesian is illustrated by means of a phonological, grammatical and lexical checklist, showing how the Riau koin{\'e} differs, on the one hand from indigenous varieties of Riau Malay, and, on the other hand from other Indonesian koin{\'e}s spoken in other provinces.},

 abstract = {In Onin, Kowiai, and the Raja Ampat Islands, three districts in the extreme west and southwest of Papua, live a number of traditional Islamic local leaders (raja) with historical and kinship links to rajas in East Seram. These rajas are the last remnants of an old trade network at the crossroads of Southeast Asia and Melanesia. For over 500 years, Seramese sailors ranged over a wide area of Papua, from the westward principalities of the Raja Ampat islands and the southern coasts of the MacCluer Gulf, to the remote and hazardous eastern coves and islets of Kowiai. They brought imported cloth and other finished products from ports in western Indonesia and beyond and exchanged them for valuable Papuan forest products and slaves.

The Seramese traders came from a group of coral reef and volcanic islands off the easternmost tip of Seram Island. Travelling in annual flotillas of trade junks made in the Kei Islands, the Seramese established small fortified trade settlements, called sosolot, initially on small coastal islands and later in protected coves. From these tiny footholds, they intermarried with Papuan mainland groups and learned a special trade lingua franca called Bahasa Onin, a mixture of Malay and local languages spoken along the coasts of the Bomberai Peninsula. Family ties and linguistic expertise gave the Seramese sosolot communities a decisive advantage over European and indigenous competitors in the lucrative trade in West Papua.

The singular trade relationship between the archipelagoes of southeast Seram and the southwest coast of Papua was known throughout the Indonesian archipelago long before the coming of the Europeans. The fourteenth century Javanese poem, the Negarakertagama, made explicit mention of ``Wwanin'' and ``Seran'' as important lands under the control of the Majapahit empire (Rouffaer 1908:328). ``Wwanin'' or Onin was a gloss for the lands bordering the south western portion of the MacCluer Gulf, and ``Seran'' referred to the east coast of Seram, the southeastern archipelagos, and the southwestern Papuan coasts. Indigenous traders labelled the relationship sosolot, a term of an uncertain, possibly Malay, origin which the seventeenth century explorer Johannes Keyts defined as a marked jurisdiction of a ``hill or harbour, where a flag was planted and where no other may trade on pain of death.'' (van Hille 1905). Nineteenth-century Dutch travel accounts still made explicit mention of the sosolot monopolies held by villages or kin groups in archipelagic Southeast Seram (Kolff 1840, Riedel 1886, de Clerq 1891).},

 abstract = {WALS is a large database of structural (phonological, grammatical, lexical) properties of languages gathered from descriptive materials (such as reference grammars) by a team of more than 40 authors  (many of them the leading authorities on the subject).

WALS consists of 141 maps with accompanying texts on diverse features (such as vowel inventory size, noun-genitive order, passive constructions, and {\dq}hand{\dq}/{\dq}arm{\dq} polysemy), each of which is the responsibility of a single author (or team of authors). Each map shows between 120 and 1110 languages, each language being represented by a symbol, and different symbols showing different values of the feature. Altogether 2,650 languages are shown on the maps, and more than 58,000 datapoints give information on features in particular languages.

WALS thus makes information on the structural diversity of the world's languages available to a large audience, including interested nonlinguists as well as linguists who would not normally read grammars of exotic languages or specialized works by comparative linguists. Although endangered languages are not particularly emphasized, they are automatically foregrounded because of the large sample of languages represented on each map, where each language (independently of its number of speakers) is shown by a single symbol.},

 abstract = {Somewhat paradoxically, the plural of personal pronouns has been considered both as a core phenomenon of nominal number and as something that has nothing to do with it. On the one hand, several scholars have suggested that if a language has a number distinction anywhere, then it has it at least in pronouns, or, speaking in diachronic terms, that plurality has spread from plural personal pronouns to other nominals (cf. Forchheimer 1953: 12). On the other hand, linguists have repeatedly argued that pronominal plurals are different from nominal plurals in that the two have a different reference structure. Thus, it is observed that `we' is not the same as `I + I + $\ldots$ I' (e.g. Benveniste 1966a, Barulin 1980; cf. also Corbett 2000: 83-84). This chapter provides an account of what types of formal correlations between plurals and singulars are actually observed in personal pronouns, and how the devices for expressing pronominal plurality relate to the devices for expressing nominal plurality. It is based on 260 languages, including the 200 languages of the WALS sample, and will thus contribute further empirical data to the discussion.},

 abstract = {Although Indonesian became the official national language of the Republic of Indonesia with independence in 1945, the use of various forms of Malay throughout the area of modern-day Indonesia existed long before the language achieved official status.  Similarly, some form of Malay was introduced into Papua centuries before Papua became an official region of Indonesia. Nowadays, a form (or forms) of Malay has been reported to exist throughout Papua that purportedly differs lexically, phonologically, and grammatically relative to the ``standard'' Indonesian that functions as the national language.  Because of limited data upon which to verify such assertions and with a desire to contribute to the documentation of Malay(s) spoken in Papua, a project was initiated to document language use and attitudes toward Papuan Malay(s) and to describe some of its key linguistic features.

This paper details an on-going survey undertaken by SIL staff in the Papua region.  A synchronic picture will be presented of selected lexical, phonological, morphological, syntactic and discourse features observed in Papuan Malay, derived from analysis of recorded natural texts elicited from native speakers. In addition, a description of language use patterns as well as attitudes towards Papuan Malay(s) will be presented based on data collected from a combination of sociolinguistic questionnaires, interviews, and observation.  Primary attention will be given to the presentation of information collected from the northeast coastal region.

Although the emphasis of this paper is to present a synchronic picture of some key linguistic features of Papuan Malay(s), historical background research will also be used to facilitate presentation of a diachronic picture of the development of Papuan Malay in the region.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a list of typical properties of the languages of Central/ Eastern (C/E) Indonesia, covering roughly the geographical area between Lombok and Papua. It focuses on those characteristics that set apart the C/E Indonesian languages from the Austronesian languages toward the west. A synthesis of recently published data on C/E Indonesian languages, the present paper provides an updated typological window on an area that is relatively under-represented in Austronesian research. It is argued that a typological characterization of a linguistic area like this can be used as a heuristic tool in comparative research. Because the area under consideration is geographically defined, the data do not have any direct bearing on issues of genetic subgrouping. Nevertheless, because all but one of the features listed here are those of Austronesian languages, they may be used to formulate hypotheses about the higher-order genetic affiliation of a language whose affiliation to a particular family (e.g., whether Austronesian or not) is yet uncertain. This is especially relevant for C/E Indonesia as a contact zone of languages with different (or unknown) genetic affiliations. How the list of typological features may be used to formulate specific hypotheses about contact- induced linguistic change is illustrated.},

Linguistically, this geographic region displays great genetic diversity, being the meeting ground of languages belonging to the Austronesian and Papuan language families. Yet, similarities cut across many of these

languages, giving rise to the notion of a linguistic area or Sprachbund.

Word lists were taken and a short discussion on the sociolinguistic situation in these areas was written. Since that time, people from Samarokena have contacted the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) in Abepura, requesting that they begin language work in their area. At various times during the past twenty-five years, Samarokena has been on and off the SIL priority allocation list.

In July 1998, Felix Ma of SIL came to Irian Jaya to check out potential allocation sites for beginning language work. He was interested in working in a coastal setting. This, coupled with Mark Donohue and Duane Clouse also being involved in doing survey work at the time, created a good reason to revisit the North coast area and reassess the linguistic and sociolinguistic situation there, as well as to give Felix Ma an opportunity to see this part of Irian Jaya.

The goals of the survey were to (1) take more up to date, complete word lists, (2) gather some grammatical data, (3) reassess the sociolinguistic situation, (4) reassess the status of translation needs, and (5) give Felix Ma an opportunity to have a taste of survey work and see the interior.

Through the help of Agus Maniagasi of Yajasi, a double outrigger canoe, a twenty-five hp.motor, and two operators were arranged to take us from Sarmi to the villages we wished to visit for the next five days. The survey team provided the fuel and oil for the motor and food for the operators. We were able to leave Sentani, arrive in Sarmi, check in with the police, arrange the boat, and travel to Masep on the first day. Traveling westward, the sea was calm.

The second day we traveled to the village of Mantarbori in the Yoke language area and spent the night. The third day we visited the village of Subu in the Airoran language area and spent the night there. The fourth day we returned to Masep in the morning and then walked to Karfasia in the Samarokena language area. We spent the day there and then walked back to Masep and spent the night. The fifth day we returned to Sarmi and made arrangements to fly back to Sentani on the next day.},

In this chapter the focus is on the absence of some of the classes of sounds which typically occur in the world's languages, and on where these absences occur. Absences of three classes of consonant sounds --- bilabials, fricatives, and nasals --- which occur in the vast majority of languages will be discussed. Each of these terms will be defined before discussion of the geographical distribution of the pattern. Absence of a fourth class of common consonants, laterals, is discussed in chapter 8.

Of the languages whose consonant inventories were analyzed for this chapter, 502 (or 88.7{\%}) have at least one representative of each of the three classes of consonants being discussed, and only 64 (or 11.3{\%}) show the absence of one or more of them. The languages with all the classes present are classed into an ``all present'' category. A striking fact is that not a single language on the Eurasian landmass shows an absence of any of these consonant classes.

@incollection{Maddieson.2008c,
 abstract = {The size of the sets of consonants and vowels which form the segment inventories of languages have been discussed in chapters 1 and 2. In addition to the number of segments that languages use, it is also important to consider the ways that the segments are allowed to combine with each other in making longer structures, such as words and syllables. Some languages allow very free combination of segments, while in others the

combinations are strongly restricted. In this chapter the complexity of sequencing of segments within syllables will be discussed as a means of examining one important aspect of how the combination of individual sounds is governed across the sampled set of languages.

The syllable is a well-recognized unit in linguistic analysis which explains quite well the number of rhythmic units that will be perceived in a word or longer utterance. This number is usually equal to the number of vowels in the utterance. Although it is usually easy to get agreement on the number of syllables present in a word, intuitions sometimes differ over where the boundaries between one syllable and another should be placed. Despite such hesitation, the syllable has proven to be a very useful concept in discussing the general rules for distribution of sounds in languages. Where listeners differ in syllabifying particular words, it is generally the case that both possible syllabifications can be shown to be permitted ones since unambiguous cases of each type can be found. For example, an English word such as pastry might be syllabified by different speakers as past.ry or as pas.try (where the dot represents a division between syllables). Since both paste and tree are perfectly acceptable monosyllabic words of English, either division will agree with a broader rule concerning possible syllables of English. The broadest rules of this kind for any given language describe what is called the canonical syllable pattern of the language. This is the pattern which essentially characterizes how many consonants may occur before the vowel in a syllable, and how many after the vowel.},

 abstract = {Foreigners often say that English language is {\dq}easy.{\dq} A language like Spanish is challenging in its variety of verb endings (the verb speak is conjugated hablo, hablas, hablamos), and gender for nouns, whereas English is more straight forward (I speak, you speak, we speak). But linguists generally swat down claims that certain languages are {\dq}easier{\dq} than others, since it is assumed all languages are complex to the same degree. For example, they will point to English's use of the word {\dq}do{\dq} -- Do you know French? This usage is counter-intuitive and difficult for non-native speakers. Linguist John McWhorter agrees that all languages are complex, but questions whether or not they are all equally complex. The topic of complexity has become a hot issue in recent years, particularly in creole studies, historical linguistics, and language contact. As McWhorter describes, when languages came into contact over the years (when French speakers ruled the English for a few centuries, or the vikings invaded England), a large number of speakers are forced to learn a new language quickly, and this came up with a simplified version, a pidgin. When this ultimately turns into a {\dq}real{\dq} language, a creole, the result is still simpler and less complex than a {\dq}non-interrupted{\dq} language that has been around for a long time. McWhorter makes the case that this kind of simplification happens in degrees, and criticizes linguists who are reluctant to say that, for example, English is simply simpler than Spanish for socio-historical reasons. He analyzes how various languages that seem simple but are not creoles, actually are simpler than they would be if they had not been broken down by large numbers of adult learners. In addition to English, he looks at Mandarin Chinese, Persian, Malay, and some Arabic varieties. His work will interest not just experts in creole studies and historical linguistics, but the wider community interested in language complexity.},

 abstract = {There are many historical references to the role of Malay as a lingua franca, dating back hundreds of years and perhaps further. There are also references in the literature to a reduced form of Malay termed Bazaar Malay (Bahasa Melayu Pasar). However, there has been little investigation of Bazaar Malay itself. Was it a trade jargon, a pidgin, a koin{\'e}, or simply a register or a colloquial variety of Malay? What was the precise form of language contact which gave rise to geographically dispersed varieties of Malay in locations such as Jakarta, Manado, Maluku and Nusatenggara?

This study examines the literature on the historical roles of Malay and Bazaar Malay, and traces the history of the language from available sources to show that Bazaar Malay has functioned as a low variety of the language in tandem with standard Malay. Phonological, morphological, lexical, and syntactic affinities among modern creolized varieties of Malay, including Betawi, Manado Malay, and Sri Lanka Creole Malay are cited to argue that modern colloquial Bahasa Indonesia is part of a continuum of reduced varieties of Malay which derive from Bazaar Malay. Reduced pronomial systems, use of punya to indicate possession, and simplified morphology are some of the shared characteristics of these varieties.},

 abstract = {The field of Malay Dialectology has only recently begun to receive attention, and identification and description of Malay varieties is only now being undertaken seriously . This paper attempts to develop a coherent framework for approaching the description and analysis of Malay dialects.

The Malay language is an important language in Southeast Asia, with approximately 40 million native speakers and over 140 million second-language speakers (C. Grimes 1996:720) and it is a national language in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore. Despite its important status in the region, the range of varieties of the language is little understood. Few attempts have been made to even describe the complex social, political and linguistic factors involved in the language situation.

A classification of Malay varieties into three categories: ``mother-tongue'' Malay, ``lingua franca'' Malay, and ``official'' Malay has been attributed to Prentice (1978:19-20). Although Prentice did not actually make this explicit classification, which is based on an interpretation of his words by B.D. Grimes (1991) and a reinterpretation and extension of B.D. Grimes' words by C. Grimes (1996), the classification itself provides a useful, though incomplete, basis for further refinement. Adelaar and Prentice (1996:673) provide an improvement on this classification:

``Roughly, three distinct Malay categories of sociolects can be distinguished for this period [the 16th-20th centuries], (1) literary Malay (also Classical Malay), (2) lingua franca Malay, and (3) `inherited' Malay.'' 

This classification is better than the Prentice/Grimes model, but it is still incomplete. Certain aspects of the language situation which are important in defining and explaining Malay dialectology have been overlooked by many observers. Primary among these is the diglossic nature of the Malay language, a situation found from the very beginning of the historical record and continuing to the present day.

To gain an understanding of the current relations between varieties of Malay, it is important to first look at the historical development of the Malay language.},

@inproceedings{Paauw.2007,
 abstract = {Historical language contact between Malay speakers and speakers of other languages has given rise to contact varieties of Malay, both within the Indonesian archipelago and outside. These varieties can be classified into four types of contact varieties: (1) languages which have arisen in trade centers of eastern Indonesia which are spoken natively by the local population (Ambon Malay, Manado Malay, Kupang Malay, etc.), (2) languages used in trade centers of eastern Indonesia which have not acquired large numbers of native speakers (although some may be currently in the process of doing so) (Makasar Malay, the Malay of Indonesian Papua, etc.), (3) pidgin languages which have arisen in the traditional Malay homeland for communication with non-Malay groups (one example is the variety known as Bahasa Melayu Pasar in peninsular Malaysia), and (4) languages which have arisen in communities of Malay speakers (or communities using Malay as a lingua franca) transplanted outside of the Malay world (Sri Lanka Malay, Nonthaburi Malay, Melayoe Sini, etc.).

Each of these Malay contact varieties shares certain features due to their origins in the varieties of Malay which have been used as lingua francas for centuries. These varieties are all based on typologically similar varieties of colloquial, or ``low'', Malay, and similar varieties are still used throughout the area traditionally considered the Malay heartland (Borneo, Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and Jakarta).

In addition, each of the contact varieties of Malay has features which are unique to a single variety or group of varieties, and which have arisen through the contact between Malay and the substrate and colonial or majority languages in each area.

This study presents a summary of the typological features which are found in Malay contact varieties, both those which are shared by these varieties and those which are found in individual varieties. The historical sources of these features and their implications for a better understanding of the spread of the Malay language are discussed.},

 abstract = {Many languages of New Guinea (i.e. Austronesian and Papuan) may consider to have no passives in their grammar. Such languages show active structure strongly (Shopen, 1992).  However, they may also demonstrate various strategies for passivization. Passives are normally constructed from transitive and/or ditransitive verbs of which agent-patient interaction are clearly stated. Kroeger (2004) argues that passivization occurs when two changes are assigned in grammatical relations: the patient from direct object to subject; and the agent from subject to oblique argument.

One of Austronesian languages of New Guinea is Melayu Papua, a variety of Melayu spoken by people in the western part of the New Guinea Island as a lingua franca (Foley, 1986). It is a Melayu variety, which has a long-standing history of language contact with Papuan languages and other Austronesians in the area. One of the results of such a contact is how to make a passive sentence that, more or less, resembles among languages in the New Guinea region.

 abstract = {A series of rapid appraisal surveys were conducted during 2007 at various locations in Papua, Indonesia as a means of providing an overview of some key linguistic and sociolinguistic features of the regional Malay variety/varieties (denoted herein as Papuan Malay) spoken on or near the coastal regions of Papua. To accomplish the survey, native speakers of Papuan Malay (PM) conducted informal group interviews regarding sociolinguistic features of PM via focus groups held in both urban and rural locations in each of five major kabupatens in the coastal region (Jayapura, Sorong, FakFak, Merauke, Mimika). All group interview participants were asked to complete an individual questionnaire regarding personal language use and family language use history. In addition, recorded texts and targeted elicitations were collected from a sub-group of

the group interview participants. Finally, choice of language used and speaker/listener demographics were recorded for conversations observed (N = 989) in a variety of domains. Background research indicates that PM is likely historically derived from other eastern regional Malays (e.g., Ambonese Malay, North Moluccan Malay, etc.) which have their roots in a bazaar Malay used as a trade language. Sociolinguistically, PM vitality was observed to be strong and its use widespread. Shift from use of vernacular languages to PM appears to have been strong over the last couple of generations, particularly for those raised in Papua's urban centers. Papuan Malay is used in all domains except in some formal situations in both the educational (e.g., delivering formal instruction) and religious (e.g., preaching, leading corporate prayer) domains.

Language attitudes towards PM are quite positive among indigenous Papuans and desire for the development of written materials in PM was expressed. Linguistically, preliminary analysis of the data corroborates previous conclusions in the literature that PM exhibits some key differences with standard Indonesian in the areas of phonology, syntax, morphology, and lexicon. Discourse features were also observed to differ. In conclusion, we believe there is strong justification for the establishment of an official language development program in Papuan Malay.},

@book{Tebay.2005,
 abstract = {West Papua is the western half of the island of New Guinea (the eastern half is the independent state of Papua New Guinea). It is situated just 250 kms to the north of Australia. In recent years the territory has been variously known as Irian Jaya (the Indonesian term for the territory), West Papua or simply as Papua. This Comment uses the term West Papua. (For a further note on terminology, see the Afterword on page 28.)

West Papua was occupied by Indonesia in May 1963. Since that time Indonesia has denied indigenous Papuans a genuine opportunity for self-determination. Papuans are now facing a real threat to their survival in their own land, due to continued subjugation and suppression by the Indonesian authorities, ongoing crimes against humanity committed by the Indonesian military, and the neglect of their socio-economic and cultural rights.  Despite these injustices, Papuans -- supported by civil society organisations at a national and international level -- have been working for lasting peace. Yet the efforts of the peace movement and the continued injustices suffered by indigenous Papuans go largely unreported in the western media.

This Comment intends to describe the injustices in West Papua.  The first part gives the historical background, examining in particular the role of Indonesia, the Netherlands, the United States and the United Nations in denying Papuans the right to self-determination in the 1960s. The second part describes the threat to the continued survival of indigenous Papuans. The third part reviews Indonesia's policies towards West Papua, while part four examines the international community's approach. Part five deals with peacebuilding initiatives by civil society in West Papua. The Comment concludes with recommendations for addressing the continued injustices faced by indigenous Papuans in their own land.  This Comment is being published by CIIR to help raise awareness of the situation in West Papua. It is followed by an Afterword which outlines what CIIR is doing to promote peace in West Papua.},

 abstract = {With the expansion of Dutch colonial control over the western part of the island of New Guinea, the territory's eastern bird's head-shaped tip came to be named the Vogelkop. It is sometimes referred to as Doberai, a term of unknown origin. Since the Indonesian acquisition of West New Guinea in 1963, the Indonesian translation of Vogelkop, Kepala Burung, was brought into fashion. This article reviews the main historical and anthropological materials related to the Southwestern Kepala Burung. It focuses on the Teminabuan area in the south-western part of the Kepala Burung, where I worked among the Imyan and Tehit people in 1994, 1995 and 1996. Based on material collected during that period, I wrote a dissertation titled Living with Intricate Futures: Order and Confusion in Imyan Worlds, Irian Jaya, Indonesia (2000) that is also available on Papuaweb.},

@book{Tjia.2007b,
 abstract = {This book is the first grammar on Ternate Malay, a local variety of Malay spoken on the island of Ternate, North-Moluccas, Indonesia. It is a language with words flexible in function and meaning, which do not bear overtly expressed features to indicate grammatical functions. Linguistic tools traditionally used to distinguish between word classes do not work satisfactorily for this language. 

Certain lexical items and their position in a string of words serve as indicators of relationships between the words and determine the meaning they express. The preference for particular types of constructions and other combinatory abilities serve to limit the number of plausible interpretations and facilitate the determining of meaningful word constructions. The linguistic context and the non-linguistic situation determine the most appropriate interpretation of structures and the meaning they express. 

Various kinds of constructions are analyzed, described, and illustrated with examples from stories, told by a young Ternate Malay speaker. The word order, different types of possessive constructions, spatial orientation, and other linguistic topics of interest are described and discussed. The grammar aims to complement linguistic descriptions of Malay varieties in general, and particularly those in eastern Indonesia. The Ternate Malay texts and examples display spontaneous and naturally spoken Malay used as the daily language of communication in Ternate. The accompanying CD-rom contains texts with sound files and a Ternate Malay-English wordlist.},

@book{vanValin.2001,
 abstract = {This comprehensive textbook is an engaging introduction to syntax. Clearly organized and accessible, it provides students with a thorough grounding in the analysis of syntactic structure using data from a typologically wide variety of languages. The book guides students through the basic concepts involved in syntactic analysis and goes on to prepare them for further work in any syntactic theory, using examples from a range of phenomena in human languages. It also includes a chapter on theories of syntax. Each chapter includes generous exercises and recommendations for further study. The emphasis on languages and data sets this book apart from other introductions to syntax. This book is an essential text for undergraduate and graduate students on courses devoted to the study of syntax. It will also be very valuable to students in other cognitive science fields who are interested in language.

The organization of the book is as follows. In this chapter a number of distinctions that are relevant to the discussion in the remainder of the book are introduced. First, two aspects of syntactic structure are distinguished, one of which will be the main topic of chapters 2 and 3, and the other will be the main topic of chapter 4. Second, the traditional notion of parts of speech are reviewed, as these categories will be important throughout the book. Finally, a brief introduction to some of the basic concepts of morphology and morphological analysis is presented, with emphasis on those notions that will be especially pertinent to the discussion in the succeeding chapters.

The next three chapters present basic syntactic phenomena from two different analytic perspectives and introduce the concepts and analytic tools used in each. Many of the same grammatical phenomena will be analyzed from each perspective. Determining the constituent structure of sentences is the major topic of chapter 4. In chapter 5 the basics of writing a grammar to describe syntactic phenomena will be presented; the formulation of rules to express the generalizations arising from syntactic analysis and the role of the lexicon in a grammar will be discussed. Different linguistic theories make different sets of assumptions about the nature of syntactic structure and accordingly employ different analytic principles and tools. In chapter 6 the basic ideas of four linguistic theories will be summarized, and their approaches to important grammatical phenomena, including the formation of information questions (e.g. What did you see?) and the passive voice (e.g. The bread was eaten by the mouse), will be compared and contrasted. These two phenomena are especially revealing for a comparison of theories, because the accounts given by the various theories highlight the conceptual and analytic differences among them.},

 abstract = {The pattern of language use in a multilingual community tells us much about the attitudes and values that are the driving forces in that society. Their attitude toward neighbouring communities, the national community, and their own value as a distinct subculture is {\~{}}eflected in the way a people use the languages in their repertoire. The value they place on change vs. maintenance of the status quo, or even trying to recapture an earlier time in their life and glory as a people, is revealed by the way a community chooses to limit the appropriateness of one language over another in various situations. This study examines language use at Namatota, a small village on the southwest coast of Irian Jaya, Indonesia. First of all, I will describe the social setting in which language use takes place at Namatota. Then I will examine the four major languages in use at Namatota and several models for the description of multilingualism. Lastly, I want to examine the constraints on language choice, which reveal underlying values and attitudes. These values and attitudes affect language use at Namatota today and determine trends for the future.},
